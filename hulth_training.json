{"abstract": "One of the hallmarks of human cognition is the capacity to generalize over arbitrary constituents. Marcus (Cognition 66, p.153; Cognitive Psychology 37, p. 243, 1998) argued that this capacity, called \"universal generalization\" (universality), is not supported by connectionist models. Instead, universality is best explained by classical symbol systems, with connectionism as its implementation. Here it is argued that universality is also a problem for classicism in that the syntax-sensitive rules that are supposed to provide causal explanations of mental processes are either too strict, precluding possible generalizations; or too lax, providing no information as to the appropriate alternative. Consequently, universality is not explained by a classical theory ", "keyword": "classicism; universality; classical component of mind; human cognition;;universal generalization; connectionist models; classical symbol;systems; syntax-sensitive rules; causal explanations; mental processes;", "title": "Does classicism explain universality?

LOT concerns the semantically relevant structure of representations involved in cognitive states such as beliefs and desires. It maintains that all such representations must have syntactic structures mirroring the structure of their contents. IBS is a thesis about the nature of the relations that connect cognitive representations and their parts to their contents (semantic relations). It holds that these relations supervene solely on relations of the kind that support information content, perhaps with some help from logical principles of combination. Atomism is a thesis about the nature of the content of simple symbols. It holds that each substantive simple symbol possesses its content independently of all other symbols in the representational system.

While such a thesis has been defended by several authors elsewhere, our primary concern here is to take up the issue of the compatibility of selective representing and realism. We hope to show three things. First, that the notion of selective representing is fully consistent with the realist idea of a mind-independent world. Second, that not only are these two consistent, but that the latter (the realist conception of a mind-independent world) provides the most powerful perspective from which to motivate and understand the differing perceptual and cognitive profiles themselves.

Tools and results of multivariable statistics are used to show that, under a variety of assumed distributions on the elements, square processes of higher dimension tend to be more difficult to identify and control, whereas the expected controllability and identifiability of nonsquare processes depends on the relative numbers of measured and manipulated variables.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we propose a robust self-tuning PID controller suitable for nonlinear systems. The control system employs a preload relay (P_Relay) in series with a PID controller. The P_Relay ensures a high gain to yield a robust performance. However, it also incurs a chattering phenomenon. In this paper, instead of viewing the chattering as an undesirable yet inevitable feature, we use it as a naturally occurring signal for tuning and re-tuning the PID controller as the operating regime digresses. No other explicit input signal is required. Once the PID controller is tuned for a particular operating point, the relay may be disabled and chattering ceases correspondingly. However, it is invoked when there is a change in setpoint to another operating regime. In this way, the approach is also applicable to time-varying systems as the PID tuning can be continuous, based on the latest set of chattering characteristics. Analysis is provided on the stability properties of the control scheme.

The proposed model consists of two groups of synaptic weights: competitive interlayer and Hebbian intralayer connections, which are responsible for encoding respectively the spatial and temporal features of the input sequence. Three additional mechanisms allow the network to deal with shared states: context units, neurons disabled from learning, and redundancy used to encode sequence states.

Most of the pertinent research has employed genetic algorithms or variations thereof. Research has applied an alternative evolutionary method, evolution strategies, to the generation of simple Braitenberg vehicles.

Motivated by this useful speedup, the paper investigates the evolution of more complex architectures, receptive-field controllers, that can employ nonlinear interactions and, therefore, can yield more complex behavior. It is interesting to note that the evolution strategy yields the same efficacy in terms of function evaluations, even though the second class of controllers requires up to 10 times more parameters than the simple Braitenberg architecture.

{"abstract": "From the dawn of modern neural network theory, the mammalian cerebellum has been a favored object of mathematical modeling studies. Early studies focused on the fanout, convergence, thresholding, and learned weighting of perceptual-motor signals within the cerebellar cortex. This led to the still viable idea that the granule cell stage in the cerebellar cortex performs a sparse expansive recoding of the time-varying input vector. This recoding reveals and emphasizes combinations in a distributed representation that serves as a basis for the learned, state-dependent control actions engendered by cerebellar outputs to movement related centers. To make optimal use of available signals, the cerebellum must be able to sift the evolving state representation for the most reliable predictors of the need for control actions, and to use those predictors even if they appear only transiently and well in advance of the optimal time for initiating the control action.

This work compares the automated DEM extraction results using an ASTER stereo pair and a SPOT stereo pair over an area of hilly mountains in Drum Mountain, Utah, when compared to a USGS 7.5-min DEM standard product. The result shows that SPOT produces better DEM results in terms of accuracy and details, if the radiometric variations between the images, taken on subsequent satellite revolutions, are small. Otherwise, the ASTER stereo pair is a better choice because of simultaneous along-track acquisition during a single pass. Compared to the USGS 7.5-min DEM, the ASTER and the SPOT extracted DEMs have a standard deviation of 11.6 and 4.6 m, respectively ", "keyword": "automated digital elevation model extraction; along-track ASTER data;;across-track SPOT stereo images; stereo satellite images; ASTER stereo;pair; SPOT stereo image pair; radiometric variations; simultaneous;along-track acquisition;", "title": "Comparison of automated digital elevation model extraction results using \talong-track ASTER and across-track SPOT stereo images"}
{"abstract": "Storage and transmission requirements for hyperspectral data sets are significant. To reduce hardware costs, well-designed compression techniques are needed to preserve information content while maximizing compression ratios. Lossless compression techniques maintain data integrity, but yield small compression ratios. We present a slightly lossy compression algorithm that uses the noise statistics of the data to preserve information content while maximizing compression ratios. The adaptive principal components analysis (APCA) algorithm uses noise statistics to determine the number of significant principal components and selects only those that are required to represent each pixel to within the noise level.

In this paper, we will discuss an optimization problem of the three-element type DVA on the basis of the H/sub 2/ optimization criterion. The objective of the H/sub 2/ optimization is to reduce the total vibration energy of the system for overall frequencies; the total area under the power spectrum response curve is minimized in this criterion. If the system is subjected to random excitation instead of sinusoidal excitation, then the H/sub 2/ optimization is probably more desirable than the popular H/sub infinity / optimization. In the past decade there has been increasing interest in the three-element type DVA. However, most previous studies on this type of DVA were based on the H/sub infinity / optimization design, and no one has been able to find the algebraic solution as of yet. We found a closed-form exact solution for a special case where the primary system has no damping. Furthermore, the general case solution including the damped primary system is presented in the form of a numerical solution.

The model includes nonlinear dynamics of the manipulator, a constitutive model of Shape Memory Alloy, and electrical and heat transfer behavior of SMA wire. This model is used for open and closed loop motion simulations of the manipulator. Experiments are presented that show results similar to both closed and open loop simulation results.

Recency is found in the 'going concern' judgments of staff auditors, but is successfully eliminated by the auditor's use of a simple self-review technique that would be extremely easy to implement in audit practice. Auditors who self-review are also less inclined to make audit report choices that are inconsistent with their going concern judgments. These results are important because the judgments of staff auditors often determine the type and extent of documentation in audit workpapers and serve as preliminary inputs for senior auditors' judgments and choices. If staff auditors' judgments are affected by recency, the impact of this bias may be impounded in the ultimate judgments and choices of senior auditors. Since biased judgments can expose auditors to significant costs involving extended audit procedures, legal liability and diminished reputation, simple debiasing techniques that reduce this exposure are valuable.

{"abstract": "Consider a situation in which a quantum system is secretly prepared in a state chosen from the known set of states. We present a principle that gives a definite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the system and those that disturb the states. The principle is derived by alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a fundamental property of quantum ones. The principle can be cast into a simple form by using a decomposition of the relevant Hilbert space, which is uniquely determined by the set of possible states. The decomposition implies the classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state: one storing it classically, one storing it nonclassically, and the other one storing no information. Then the principle states that the nonclassical part is inaccessible and the classical part is read-only if we are to preserve the state of the system. From this principle, many types of no-cloning, no-broadcasting, and no-imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general forms including mixed states.

In order to guarantee the convergence to the solution of the continuous nonlinear problem, it is necessary to determine how accurately the linear BVPs must be solved. For this goal, suitable stopping criteria on the residual and on the error for each linear BVP are given.

{"abstract": "This study considers the subjective evaluation of ride quality during ambulance transportation using an actively-controlled stretcher (ACS). The ride quality of a conventional stretcher and an assistant driver's seat is also compared. Braking during ambulance transportation generates negative foot-to-head acceleration in patients and causes blood pressure to rise in the patient's head. The ACS absorbs the foot-to-head acceleration by changing the angle of the stretcher, thus reducing the blood pressure variation. However, the ride quality of the ACS should be investigated further because the movement of the ACS may cause motion sickness and nausea. Experiments of ambulance transportation, including rapid acceleration and deceleration, are performed to evaluate the effect of differences in posture of the transported subject on the ride quality; the semantic differential method and factor analysis are used in the investigations. Subjects are transported using a conventional stretcher with head forward, a conventional stretcher with head backward, the ACS, and an assistant driver's seat for comparison with transportation using a stretcher. Experimental results show that the ACS gives the most comfortable transportation when using a stretcher. Moreover, the reduction of the negative foot-to-head acceleration at frequencies below 0.2 Hz and the small variation of the foot-to-head acceleration result in more comfortable transportation.

{"abstract": "A key element in the overall efficiency of a manufacturing enterprise is the compatibility between the features that have been created in a newly designed part, and the capabilities of the downstream manufacturing processes. With this in mind, a process-aware computer aided design (CAD) system called WebCAD has been developed. The system restricts the freedom of the designer in such a way that the designed parts can be manufactured on a three-axis computer numerical control milling machine. This paper discusses the vision of WebCAD and explains the rationale for its development in comparison with commercial CAD/CAM (computer aided design/manufacture) systems. The paper then goes on to describe the implementation issues that enforce the manufacturability rules. Finally, certain design tools are described that aid a user during the design process.

{"abstract": "This paper deals with two questions: Does social capital determine innovation in manufacturing firms? If it is the case, to what extent? To deal with these questions, we review the literature on innovation in order to see how social capital came to be added to the other forms of capital as an explanatory variable of innovation. In doing so, we have been led to follow the dominating view of the literature on social capital and innovation which claims that social capital cannot be captured through a single indicator, but that it actually takes many different forms that must be accounted for. Therefore, to the traditional explanatory variables of innovation, we have added five forms of structural social capital (business network assets, information network assets, research network assets, participation assets, and relational assets) and one form of cognitive social capital (reciprocal trust). In a context where empirical investigations regarding the relations between social capital and innovation are still scanty, this paper makes contributions to the advancement of knowledge in providing new evidence regarding the impact and the extent of social capital on innovation at the two decisionmaking stages considered in this study ", "keyword": "innovation; manufacturing firms; business network assets; information network;assets; research network assets; participation assets; relational;assets; cognitive social capital; structural social capital; reciprocal;trust; two-stage decision-making process; degree of radicalness;", "title": "Does social capital determine innovation?

{"abstract": "The Health Level Seven (HL7), an international standard for electronic data exchange in all health care environments, enables disparate computer applications to exchange key sets of clinical and administrative information. Above all, it defines the standard HL7 message formats prescribed by the standard encoding rules. In this paper, we propose a flexible, reusable, and extensible HL7 encoding and decoding framework using a message object model (MOM) and message definition repository (MDR). The MOM provides an abstract HL7 message form represented by a group of objects and their relationships. It reflects logical relationships among the standard HL7 message elements such as segments, fields, and components, while enforcing the key structural constraints imposed by the standard. Since the MOM completely eliminates the dependency of the HL7 encoder and decoder on platform-specific data formats, it makes it possible to build the encoder and decoder as reusable standalone software components, enabling the interconnection of arbitrary heterogeneous hospital information systems (HIS) with little effort. Moreover, the MDR, an external database of key definitions for HL7 messages, helps make the encoder and decoder as resilient as possible to future modifications of the standard HL7 message formats. It is also used by the encoder and decoder to perform a well-formedness check for their respective inputs (i.e., HL7 message objects expressed in the MOM and encoded HL7 message strings). Although we implemented a prototype version of the encoder and decoder using JAVA, they can be easily packaged and delivered as standalone components using the standard component frameworks ", "keyword": "reusable framework; extensible encoding/decoding framework; Health Level Seven;;message object model; message definition repository; MDR; MOM; abstract;message form; logical relationships; structural constraints;;international standard; standalone software components; heterogeneous;hospital information systems; HIS; external database; key definitions;;JAVA; ActiveX; JAVABEAN; CORBA; electronic data exchange; health care;environments; clinical information; administrative information; HL7;message formats;", "title": "Design and implementation of a reusable and extensible HL7 encoding/decoding \tframework"}

However, this method works only for a certain class of chaotic systems with known parameters both in drive systems and response systems. Modification based on Lyapunov stability theory is proposed in order to overcome this limitation. An adaptive synchronization controller, which can make the states of two identical Rossler and Chen systems globally asymptotically synchronized in the presence of system's unknown constant parameters, is derived. Especially, when some unknown parameters are positive, we can make the controller more simple, besides, the controller is independent of those positive uncertain parameters. At last, when the condition that arbitrary unknown parameters in two systems are identical constants is cancelled, we demonstrate that it is possible to synchronize two chaotic systems. All results are proved using a well-known Lyapunov stability theorem.

Moreover, data subterms can be further classified based on the compatible data subterm relation to obtain automatically the finite set of valid acceptable terms for an honest principal. In this algorithm, terms core is designed to represent the intruder's knowledge compactly, and forward search technology is used to simulate attack patterns easily.

Having converters at some of the nodes can reduce the number of wavelengths required for routing. This paper presents a wavelength converter with degree 4 and gives a routing algorithm which shows that any routing with load L can be realized with L wavelengths when a node of an all-optical ring hosts such a wavelength converter.

{"abstract": "We consider the node-capacitated routing problem in an undirected ring network along with its fractional relaxation, the node-capacitated multicommodity flow problem. For the feasibility problem, Farkas' lemma provides a characterization for general undirected graphs, asserting roughly that there exists such a flow if and only if the so-called distance inequality holds for every choice of distance functions arising from nonnegative node weights. For rings, this (straightforward) result will be improved in two ways. We prove that, independent of the integrality of node capacities, it suffices to require the distance inequality only for distances arising from (0-1-2)-valued node weights, a requirement that will be called the double-cut condition. Moreover, for integer-valued node capacities, the double-cut condition implies the existence of a half-integral multicommodity flow. In this case there is even an integer-valued multicommodity flow that violates each node capacity by at most one. Our approach gives rise to a combinatorial, strongly polynomial algorithm to compute either a violating double-cut or a node-capacitated multicommodity flow.

{"abstract": "Approximately 70-85% of breast biopsies are performed on benign lesions. To reduce this high number of biopsies performed on benign lesions, a case-based reasoning (CBR) classifier was developed to predict biopsy results from BI-RADS/sup TM/ findings. We used 1433 (931 benign) biopsy-proven mammographic cases. CBR similarity was defined using either the Hamming or Euclidean distance measure over case features. Ten features represented each case: calcification distribution, calcification morphology, calcification number, mass margin, mass shape, mass density, mass size, associated findings, special cases, and age. Performance was evaluated using Round Robin sampling, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, and bootstrap. To determine the most influential features for the CBR, an exhaustive feature search was performed over all possible feature combinations (1022) and similarity thresholds. Influential features were defined as the most frequently occurring features in the feature subsets with the highest partial ROC areas (/sub 0.90/AUC). For CBR with Hamming distance, the most influential features were found to be mass margin, calcification morphology, age, calcification distribution, calcification number, and mass shape, resulting in an /sub 0.90/AUC of 0.33. At 95% sensitivity, the Hamming CBR would spare from biopsy 34% of the benign lesions. At 98% sensitivity, the Hamming CBR would spare 27% benign lesions. For the CBR with Euclidean distance, the most influential feature subset consisted of mass margin, calcification morphology, age, mass density, and associated findings, resulting in /sub 0.90/AUC of 0.37. At 95% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare from biopsy 41% benign lesions. At 98% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare 27% benign lesions.

{"abstract": "Purpose: In breast conserving therapy, complete excision of the tumor with an acceptable cosmetic outcome depends on accurate localization in terms of both the position of the lesion and its extent. We hypothesize that preoperative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the patient in a supine position may be used for accurate tumor localization and marking of its extent immediately prior to surgery. Our aims in this study are to assess the reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position, to evaluate the effect of a breast immobilization device, and to derive reproducibility margins that take internal tissue shifts into account occurring between repeat setups. Materials Methods: The reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position is estimated by quantification of tissue shifts in the breasts of healthy volunteers between repeat MR setups. For each volunteer fiducials are identified and registered with their counter locations in corresponding MR volumes. The difference in position denotes the shift of breast tissue. The dependence on breast volume and the part of the breast, as well as the effect of a breast immobilization cast are studied. Results: The tissue shifts are small with a mean standard deviation on the order of 1.5 mm, being slightly larger in large breasts (V>1000 cm/sup 3/), and in the posterior part (toward the pectoral muscle) of both small and large breasts. The application of a breast immobilization cast reduces the tissue shifts in large breasts. A reproducibility margin on the order of 5 mm will take the internal tissue shifts into account that occur between repeat setups.

{"abstract": "A prerequisite for accurate dose delivery of IMRT profiles produced with dynamic multileaf collimation (DMLC) is highly accurate leaf positioning. In our institution, leaf verification for DMLC was initially done with film and ionization chamber. To overcome the limitations of these methods, a fast, accurate and two-dimensional method for daily leaf verification, using our CCD-camera based electronic portal imaging device (EPID), has been developed. This method is based on a flat field produced with a 0.5 cm wide sliding gap for each leaf pair. Deviations in gap widths are detected as deviations in gray scale value profiles derived from the EPID images, and not by directly assessing leaf positions in the images. Dedicated software was developed to reduce the noise level in the low signal images produced with the narrow gaps. The accuracy of this quality assurance procedure was tested by introducing known leaf position errors. It was shown that errors in leaf gap as small as 0.01-0.02 cm could be detected, which is certainly adequate to guarantee accurate dose delivery of DMLC treatments, even for strongly modulated beam profiles. Using this method, it was demonstrated that both short and long term reproducibility in leaf positioning were within 0.01 cm (1 sigma ) for all gantry angles, and that the effect of gravity was negligible ", "keyword": "accurate leaf verification; dynamic multileaf collimation; electronic portal;imaging device; accurate dose delivery; intensity modulated radiation;therapy profiles; ionization chamber; two-dimensional method;;CCD-camera based electronic portal imaging device; sliding gap; leaf;pair; gap widths; gray scale value profiles; electronic portal imaging;device images; noise level; signal images; leaf position errors;;modulated beam profiles; leaf positioning; gantry angles;", "title": "Fast and accurate leaf verification for dynamic multileaf collimation using an \telectronic portal imaging device"}
{"abstract": "Accurate determination of the head scatter factor S/sub c/ is an important issue, especially for intensity modulated radiation therapy, where the segmented fields are often very irregular and much less than the collimator jaw settings. In this work, we report an S/sub c/ calculation algorithm for symmetric, asymmetric, and irregular open fields shaped by the tertiary collimator (a multileaf collimator or blocks) at different source-to-chamber distance. The algorithm was based on a three-source model, in which the photon radiation to the point of calculation was treated as if it originated from three effective sources: one source for the primary photons from the target and two extra-focal photon sources for the scattered photons from the primary collimator and the flattening filter, respectively. The field mapping method proposed by Kim et al. [Phys. Med. Biol. 43, 1593-1604 (1998)] was extended to two extra-focal source planes and the scatter contributions were integrated over the projected areas (determined by the detector's eye view) in the three source planes considering the source intensity distributions. The algorithm was implemented using Microsoft Visual C/C++ in the MS Windows environment. The only input data required were head scatter factors for symmetric square fields, which are normally acquired during machine commissioning. A large number of different fields were used to evaluate the algorithm and the results were compared with measurements.

{"abstract": "For quantitative image reconstruction in positron emission tomography attenuation correction is mandatory. In case that no data are available for the calculation of the attenuation correction factors one can try to determine them from the emission data alone. However, it is not clear if the information content is sufficient to yield an adequate attenuation correction together with a satisfactory activity distribution. Therefore, we determined the log likelihood distribution for a thorax phantom depending on the choice of attenuation and activity pixel values to measure the crosstalk between both. In addition an iterative image reconstruction (one-dimensional Newton-type algorithm with a maximum likelihood estimator), which simultaneously reconstructs the images of the activity distribution and the attenuation coefficients is used to demonstrate the problems and possibilities of such a reconstruction. As result we show that for a change of the log likelihood in the range of statistical noise, the associated change in the activity value of a structure is between 6% and 263%. In addition, we show that it is not possible to choose the best maximum on the basis of the log likelihood when a regularization is used, because the coupling between different structures mediated by the (smoothing) regularization prevents an adequate solution due to crosstalk. We conclude that taking into account the attenuation information in the emission data improves the performance of image reconstruction with respect to the bias of the activities, however, the reconstruction still is not quantitative ", "keyword": "image reconstruction; positron emission tomography attenuation correction;;attenuation correction factors; log likelihood distribution; thorax;phantom; activity pixel values; crosstalk; iterative image;reconstruction; one-dimensional Newton-type algorithm; maximum;likelihood estimator; activity distribution; attenuation coefficients;;statistical noise; smoothing; attenuation information;", "title": "Simultaneous iterative reconstruction of emission and attenuation images in \tpositron emission tomography from emission data only"}

{"abstract": "Emission tuned aperture computed tomography (ETACT) has been previously shown to have the potential for the detection of small tumors (<1 cm) in scintimammography. However, the optimal approach to the application of ETACT in the clinic has yet to be determined. Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of the angular disparity between the ETACT projections on image quality through the use of a computer simulation. A small, spherical tumor of variable size (5, 7.5 or 10 mm) was placed at the center of a hemispherical breast (15 cm diameter). The tumor to nontumor ratio was either 5:1 or 10:1. The detector was modeled to be a gamma camera fitted with a 4-mm-diam pinhole collimator. The pinhole-to-detector and the pinhole-to-tumor distances were 25 and 15 cm, respectively. A ray tracing technique was used to generate three sets of projections (10 degrees , 15 degrees , and 20 degrees , angular disparity). These data were blurred to a resolution consistent with the 4 mm pinhole. The TACT reconstruction method was used to reconstruct these three image sets. The tumor contrast and the axial spatial resolution was measured. Smaller angular disparity led to an improvement in image contrast but at a cost of degraded axial spatial resolution. The improvement in contrast is due to a slight improvement in the in-plane spatial resolution. Since improved contrast should lead to better tumor detectability, smaller angular disparity should be used. However, the difference in contrast between 10 degrees and 15 degrees was very slight and therefore a reasonable clinical choice for angular disparity is 15 degrees ", "keyword": "emission tuned aperture computed tomography scintimammography; angular;disparity; small tumors; image quality; computer simulation; spherical;tumor; hemispherical breast; gamma camera; pinhole collimator;;pinhole-to-detector distances; pinhole-to-tumor distances; ray tracing;technique; tuned aperture computed tomography reconstruction method;;image sets; axial spatial resolution; in-plane spatial resolution;;clinical choice;", "title": "Angular disparity in ETACT scintimammography"}

{"abstract": "radiation therapy The purpose of this work is to examine physical radiation dose differences between two multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf widths (5 and 10 mm) in the treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Three clinical patients with CNS tumors were planned with two different MLC leaf sizes, 5 and 10 mm, representing Varian-120 and Varian-80 Millennium multileaf collimators, respectively. Two sets of IMRT treatment plans were developed. The goal of the first set was radiation dose conformality in three dimensions. The goal for the second set was organ avoidance of a nearby critical structure while maintaining adequate coverage of the target volume. Treatment planning utilized the CadPlan/Helios system (Varian Medical Systems, Milpitas CA) for dynamic MLC treatment delivery. All beam parameters and optimization (cost function) parameters were identical for the 5 and 10 mm plans. For all cases the number of beams, gantry positions, and table positions were taken from clinically treated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans. Conformality was measured by the ratio of the planning isodose volume to the target volume. Organ avoidance was measured by the volume of the critical structure receiving greater than 90% of the prescription dose (V/sub 90/). For three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (T2-T4 N0-N2c M0) 5 and 10 mm leaf widths were compared for parotid preservation utilizing nine coplanar equally spaced beams delivering a simultaneous integrated boost. Because modest differences in physical dose to the parotid were detected, a NTCP model based upon the clinical parameters of Eisbruch et al. was then used for comparisons. The conformality improved in all three CNS cases for the 5 mm plans compared to the 10 mm plans. For the organ avoidance plans, V/sub 90/ also improved in two of the three cases when the 5 mm leaf width was utilized for IMRT treatment delivery. In the third case, both the 5 and 10 mm plans were able to spare the critical structure with none of the structure receiving more than 90% of the prescription dose, but in the moderate dose range, less dose was delivered to the critical structure with the 5 mm plan. For the head and neck cases both the 5 and 10*2.5 mm beamlets dMLC sliding window techniques spared the contralateral parotid gland while maintaining target volume coverage. The mean parotid dose was modestly lower with the smaller beamlet size (21.04 Gy vs 22.36 Gy). The resulting average NTCP values were 13.72% for 10 mm dMLC and 8.24% for 5 mm dMLC. In conclusion, five mm leaf width results in an improvement in physical dose distribution over 10 mm leaf width that may be clinically relevant in some cases.

{"abstract": "In order to guarantee the safe delivery of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), verification of the leaf trajectories during the treatment is necessary. Our aim in this study is to develop a method for on-line verification of leaf trajectories using an electronic portal imaging device with scanning read-out, independent of the multileaf collimator. Examples of such scanning imagers are electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) based on liquid-filled ionization chambers and those based on amorphous silicon. Portal images were acquired continuously with a liquid-filled ionization chamber EPID during the delivery, together with the signal of treatment progress that is generated by the accelerator. For each portal image, the prescribed leaf and diaphragm positions were computed from the dynamic prescription and the progress information. Motion distortion effects of the leaves are corrected based on the treatment progress that is recorded for each image row. The aperture formed by the prescribed leaves and diaphragms is used as the reference field edge, while the actual field edge is found using a maximum-gradient edge detector. The errors in leaf and diaphragm position are found from the deviations between the reference field edge and the detected field edge. Earlier measurements of the dynamic EPID response show that the accuracy of the detected field edge is better than 1 mm. To ensure that the verification is independent of inaccuracies in the acquired progress signal, the signal was checked with diode measurements beforehand. The method was tested on three different dynamic prescriptions. Using the described method, we correctly reproduced the distorted field edges. Verifying a single portal image took 0.1 s on an 866 MHz personal computer. Two flaws in the control system of our experimental dynamic multileaf collimator were correctly revealed with our method. First, the errors in leaf position increase with leaf speed, indicating a delay of approximately 0.8 s in the control system. Second, the accuracy of the leaves and diaphragms depends on the direction of motion. In conclusion, the described verification method is suitable for detailed verification of leaf trajectories during dynamic IMRT ", "keyword": "dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy; geometrical verification method;;dynamic multileaf collimator; safe delivery; leaf trajectories; on-line;verification; scanning read-out; liquid-filled ionization chambers;;leaf positions; diaphragm positions; motion distortion effects;;reference field edge; distorted field edges; control system; dose;distributions; treatment planning;", "title": "A method for geometrical verification of dynamic intensity modulated \tradiotherapy using a scanning electronic portal imaging device"}
{"abstract": "Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning typically considers beam optimization and beam delivery as separate tasks. Following optimization, a multi-leaf collimator (MLC) or other beam delivery device is used to generate fluence patterns for patient treatment delivery. Due to limitations and characteristics of the MLC, the deliverable intensity distributions often differ from those produced by the optimizer, leading to differences between the delivered and the optimized doses. Objective function parameters are then adjusted empirically, and the plan is reoptimized to achieve a desired deliverable dose distribution. The resulting plan, though usually acceptable, may not be the best achievable. A method has been developed to incorporate the MLC restrictions into the optimization process. Our in-house IMRT system has been modified to include the calculation of the deliverable intensity into the optimizer. In this process, prior to dose calculation, the MLC leaf sequencer is used to convert intensities to dynamic MLC sequences, from which the deliverable intensities are then determined. All other optimization steps remain the same. To evaluate the effectiveness of deliverable-based optimization, 17 patient cases have been studied. Compared with standard optimization plus conversion to deliverable beams, deliverable-based optimization results show improved isodose coverage and a reduced dose to critical structures. Deliverable-based optimization results are close to the original nondeliverable optimization results, suggesting that IMRT can overcome the MLC limitations by adjusting individual beamlets. The use of deliverable-based optimization may reduce the need for empirical adjustment of objective function parameters and reoptimization of a plan to achieve desired results ", "keyword": "intensity modulated radiation therapy; treatment planning; iterative;optimization; multileaf collimator leaf sequencing; beam delivery; beam;optimization; fluence patterns; objective function parameters;;deliverable dose distribution; empirical adjustment; tumor dose;;optimized intensity; gradient-based search algorithm; beamlet ray;intensities; Newton method; dose-volume objective values;", "title": "Incorporating multi-leaf collimator leaf sequencing into iterative IMRT \toptimization"}
{"abstract": "IMRT treatment plans for step-and-shoot delivery have traditionally been produced through the optimization of intensity distributions (or maps) for each beam angle. The optimization step is followed by the application of a leaf-sequencing algorithm that translates each intensity map into a set of deliverable aperture shapes. In this article, we introduce an automated planning system in which we bypass the traditional intensity optimization, and instead directly optimize the shapes and the weights of the apertures. We call this approach \"direct aperture optimization.\" This technique allows the user to specify the maximum number of apertures per beam direction, and hence provides significant control over the complexity of the treatment delivery. This is possible because the machine dependent delivery constraints imposed by the MLC are enforced within the aperture optimization algorithm rather than in a separate leaf-sequencing step. The leaf settings and the aperture intensities are optimized simultaneously using a simulated annealing algorithm. We have tested direct aperture optimization on a variety of patient cases using the EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package for our dose calculation engine. The results demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can produce highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans using only three to five apertures per beam direction. As compared with traditional optimization strategies, our studies demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can result in a significant reduction in both the number of beam segments and the number of monitor units. Direct aperture optimization therefore produces highly efficient treatment deliveries that maintain the full dosimetric benefits of IMRT ", "keyword": "direct aperture optimization; turnkey solution; step-and-shoot IMRT; IMRT;treatment plans; intensity distributions; maps; beam angle;;optimization step; leaf-sequencing algorithm; intensity map;;deliverable aperture shapes; automated planning system; aperture;weights; aperture shapes; treatment delivery complexity; machine;dependent delivery constraints; MLC; aperture optimization algorithm;;leaf settings; aperture intensities; simulated annealing algorithm;;patient cases; EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package; dose calculation engine;;highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans; beam segments; monitor;units; highly efficient treatment deliveries; full dosimetric benefits;", "title": "Direct aperture optimization: A turnkey solution for step-and-shoot IMRT"}
{"abstract": "Cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVH) are crucial in evaluating the quality of radioactive seed prostate implants. When calculating DVHs, the choice of voxel size is a compromise between computational speed (larger voxels) and accuracy (smaller voxels). We quantified the effect of voxel size on the accuracy of DVHs using an in-house computer program. The program was validated by comparison with a hand-calculated DVH for a single 0.4-U iodine-125 model 6711 seed. We used the program to find the voxel size required to obtain accurate DVHs of five iodine-125 prostate implant patients at our institution. One-millimeter cubes were sufficient to obtain DVHs that are accurate within 5% up to 200% of the prescription dose. For the five patient plans, we obtained good agreement with the VariSeed (version 6.7, Varian, USA) treatment planning software's DVH algorithm by using voxels with a sup-inf dimension equal to the spacing between successive transverse seed implant planes (5 mm). The volume that receives at least 200% of the target dose, V/sub 200/, calculated by VariSeed was 30% to 43% larger than that calculated by our program with small voxels.

{"abstract": "With MLC-based IMRT, the maximum usable field size is often smaller than the maximum field size for conventional treatments. This is due to the constraints of the overtravel distances of MLC leaves and/or jaws. Using a new leaf sequencing algorithm, the usable IMRT field length (perpendicular to the MLC motion) can be mostly made equal to the full length of the MLC field without violating the upper jaw overtravel limit. For any given intensity pattern, a criterion was proposed to assess whether an intensity pattern can be delivered without violation of the jaw position constraints. If the criterion is met, the new algorithm will consider the jaw position constraints during the segmentation for the step and shoot delivery method. The strategy employed by the algorithm is to connect the intensity elements outside the jaw overtravel limits with those inside the jaw overtravel limits. Several methods were used to establish these connections during segmentation by modifying a previously published algorithm (areal algorithm), including changing the intensity level, alternating the leaf-sequencing direction, or limiting the segment field size. The algorithm was tested with 1000 random intensity patterns with dimensions of 21*27 cm/sup 2/, 800 intensity patterns with higher intensity outside the jaw overtravel limit, and three different types of clinical treatment plans that were undeliverable using a segmentation method from a commercial treatment planning system. The new algorithm achieved a success rate of 100% with these test patterns. For the 1000 random patterns, the new algorithm yields a similar average number of segments of 36.9+or-2.9 in comparison to 36.6+or-1.3 when using the areal algorithm. For the 800 patterns with higher intensities outside the jaw overtravel limits, the new algorithm results in an increase of 25% in the average number of segments compared to the areal algorithm. However, the areal algorithm fails to create deliverable segments for 90% of these patterns. Using a single isocenter, the new algorithm provides a solution to extend the usable IMRT field length from 21 to 27 cm for IMRT on a commercial linear accelerator using the step and shoot delivery method ", "keyword": "leaf sequencing algorithm; usable intensity modulated radiation therapy field;length; overtravel distances; multileaf-based collimators intensity;modulated radiation therapy; conformal radiation therapy; multileaf;collimators jaws; multileaf collimators leaves; upper jaw overtravel;limit; intensity pattern; jaw position constraints; step and shoot;delivery method; commercial treatment planning system; random patterns;;deliverable segments; single isocenter; commercial linear accelerator;;treatment field length; intensity elements; jaw overtravel limits;;areal algorithm; leaf-sequencing direction; segment field size; random;intensity patterns; segmentation method;", "title": "A leaf sequencing algorithm to enlarge treatment field length in IMRT"}
{"abstract": "Volumes reconstructed by standard methods from single-slice helical computed tomography (CT) data have been shown to have noise levels that are highly nonuniform relative to those in conventional CT. These noise nonuniformities can affect low-contrast object detectability and have also been identified as the cause of the zebra artifacts that plague maximum intensity projection (MIP) images of such volumes. While these spatially variant noise levels have their root in the peculiarities of the helical scan geometry, there is also a strong dependence on the interpolation and reconstruction algorithms employed. In this paper, we seek to develop image reconstruction strategies that eliminate or reduce, at its source, the nonuniformity of noise levels in helical CT relative to that in conventional CT. We pursue two approaches, independently and in concert. We argue, and verify, that Fourier-based longitudinal interpolation approaches lead to more uniform noise ratios than do the standard 360LI and 180LI approaches.

Open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers are used for this purpose. They differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations.

{"abstract": "In previous work by the first author, it has been established that a dichotomically stable discretization is needed when solving a stiff boundary-value problem in ordinary differential equations (ODEs), when sharp boundary layers may occur at each end of the interval. A dichotomically stable implicit Runge-Kutta method, using the 3-stage, fourth-order, Lobatto IIIA formulae, has been implemented in a variable step-size initial-value integrator, which could be used in a multiple-shooting approach. In the case of index-one differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) the use of the Lobatto IIIA formulae has an advantage, over a comparable Gaussian method, that the order is the same for both differential and algebraic variables, and there is no need to treat them separately. The ODE integrator has been adapted for the solution of index-one DAEs, and the resulting integrator (SYMDAE) has been inserted into the multiple-shooting code (MSHDAE) previously developed by R. Lamour for differential-algebraic boundary-value problems. The standard version of MSHDAE uses a BDF integrator, which is not dichotomically stable, and for some stiff test problems this fails to integrate across the interval of interest, while the dichotomically stable integrator SYMDAE encounters no difficulty. Indeed, for such problems, the modified version of MSHDAE produces an accurate solution, and within limits imposed by computer word length, the efficiency of the solution process improves with increasing stiffness.

{"abstract": "Streaming multimedia with UDP has become increasingly popular over distributed systems like the Internet. Scientific applications that stream multimedia include remote computational steering of visualization data and video-on-demand teleconferencing over the Access Grid. However, UDP does not possess a self-regulating, congestion-control mechanism; and most best-effort traffic is served by congestion-controlled TCP. Consequently, UDP steals bandwidth from TCP such that TCP flows starve for network resources. With the volume of Internet traffic continuing to increase, the perpetuation of UDP-based streaming will cause the Internet to collapse as it did in the mid-1980's due to the use of non-congestion-controlled TCP. To address this problem, we introduce the counter-intuitive notion of inter-packet spacing with control feedback to enable UDP-based applications to perform well in the next-generation Internet and computational grids. When compared with traditional UDP-based streaming, we illustrate that our approach can reduce packet loss over 50% without adversely affecting delivered throughput ", "keyword": "streaming multimedia; UDP; distributed systems; Internet; remote computational;steering; visualization data; inter-packet spacing; UDP-based;streaming; network protocol; transport protocols;", "title": "Packet spacing: an enabling mechanism for delivering multimedia content in \tcomputational grids"}

{"abstract": "This paper presents a knowledge e-based approach dedicated to the efficient management, regulation, interactive and dynamic monitoring of urban infrastructures. This approach identifies the data and related treatments common to several municipal activities and defines the requirements and functionalities of the computer tools developed to improve the delivery and coordination of municipal services to the population. The resulting cooperative system called SIGIU is composed of a set of integrated operating systems (SYDEX) and the global planning and coordination system (SYGEC). The objective is to integrate the set of SYDEX and the SYGEC into a single coherent system for all the SIGIU's users according to their tasks, their roles, and their responsibilities within the municipal administration. SIGIU is provided by different measurement and monitoring instruments installed on some system's elements to be supervised. In this context, the information can be presented in different forms: video, pictures, data and alarms. One of SIGIU's objectives is the real-time management of urban infrastructures' control mechanisms. To carry out this process, the alarm control agent creates a mobile agent associated with the alarm, which is sent to a mobile station and warns an operator. Preliminary implementation results show that SIGIU supports effectively and efficiently the decision making process related to managing urban infrastructures ", "keyword": "knowledge-based approach; urban infrastructure management; regulation; dynamic;monitoring; municipal activities; cooperative system; SIGIU; integrated;operating systems; SYDEX; global planning system; coordination system;;SYGEC; video; real-time management; alarm control agent; mobile agent;;intelligent decision support system; urban planning; multi-agent;systems;", "title": "A knowledge-based approach for managing urban infrastructures"}
{"abstract": "Since the mid-1980s, expert systems have been developed for a variety of problems in accounting and finance. The most commonly cited problems in developing these systems are the unavailability of the experts and knowledge engineers and difficulties with the rule extraction process. Within the field of artificial intelligence, this has been called the 'knowledge acquisition' (KA) problem and has been identified as a major bottleneck in the expert system development process. Recent empirical research reveals that certain KA techniques are significantly more efficient than others in helping to extract certain types of knowledge within specific problem domains. This paper presents a mapping between these empirical studies and a generic taxonomy of expert system problem domains. To accomplish this, we first examine the range of problem domains and suggest a mapping of accounting and finance tasks to a generic problem domain taxonomy. We then identify and describe the most prominent KA techniques employed in developing expert systems in accounting and finance. After examining and summarizing the existing empirical KA work, we conclude by showing how the empirical KA research in the various problem domains can be used to provide guidance to developers of expert systems in the fields of accounting and finance ", "keyword": "knowledge acquisition; expert systems; accounting; finance; rule extraction;process; artificial intelligence; problem domain taxonomy;", "title": "Knowledge acquisition for expert systems in accounting and financial problem \tdomains"}

{"abstract": "Multiple viewpoint models of system development are becoming increasingly important. Each viewpoint offers a different perspective on the target system and system development involves parallel refinement of the multiple views. Viewpoint related approaches have been considered in a number of different guises by a spectrum of researchers. Our work particularly focuses on the use of viewpoints in open distributed processing (ODP) which is an ISO/ITU standardisation framework. The requirements of viewpoint modelling in ODP are very broad and, hence, demanding. Multiple viewpoints, though, prompt the issue of consistency between viewpoints. This paper describes a very general interpretation of consistency which we argue is broad enough to meet the requirements of consistency in ODP. We present a formal framework for this general interpretation; highlight basic properties of the interpretation and locate restricted classes of consistency. Strategies for checking consistency are also investigated. Throughout we illustrate our theory using the formal description technique LOTOS.

{"abstract": "Weighted factors analysis (WeFA) has been proposed as a new approach for elicitation, representation, and manipulation of knowledge about a given problem, generally at a high and strategic level. Central to this proposal is that a group of experts in the area of the problem can identify a hierarchy of factors with positive or negative influences on the problem outcome. The tangible output of WeFA is a directed weighted graph called a WeFA graph. This is a set of nodes denoting factors that can directly or indirectly influence an overall aim of the graph. The aim is also represented by a node. Each directed arc is a direct influence of one factor on another. A chain of directed arcs indicates an indirect influence. The influences may be identified as either positive or negative. For example, sales and costs are two factors that influence the aim of profitability in an organization. Sales has a positive influence on profitability and costs has a negative influence on profitability. In addition, the relative significance of each influence is represented by a weight. We develop Binary WeFA which is a variant of WeFA where the factors in the graph are restricted to being either true or false. Imposing this restriction on a WeFA graph allows us to be more precise about the meaning of the graph and of reasoning in it. Binary WeFA is a new proposal that provides a formal yet sufficiently simple language for logic-based argumentation for use by business people in decision-support and knowledge management. Whilst Binary WeFA is expressively simpler than other logic-based argumentation formalisms, it does incorporate a novel formalization of the notion of significance ", "keyword": "weighted factors analysis; knowledge elicitation; knowledge representation;;knowledge manipulation; significance; WeFA graph; directed arc;;profitability; organization; Binary WeFA; reasoning; logic-based;argumentation; decision-support; knowledge management; directed;weighted graph;", "title": "Formalization of weighted factors analysis"}

{"abstract": "OpenMP offers a high-level interface for parallel programming on scalable shared memory (SMP) architectures. It provides the user with simple work-sharing directives while it relies on the compiler to generate parallel programs based on thread parallelism. However, the lack of language features for exploiting data locality often results in poor performance since the non-uniform memory access times on scalable SMP machines cannot be neglected. High Performance Fortran (HPF), the de-facto standard for data parallel programming, offers a rich set of data distribution directives in order to exploit data locality, but it has been mainly targeted towards distributed memory machines. In this paper we describe an optimized execution model for HPF programs on SMP machines that avails itself with mechanisms provided by OpenMP for work sharing and thread parallelism, while exploiting data locality based on user-specified distribution directives. Data locality does not only ensure that most memory accesses are close to the executing threads and are therefore faster, but it also minimizes synchronization overheads, especially in the case of unstructured reductions. The proposed shared memory execution model for HPF relies on a small set of language extensions, which resemble the OpenMP work-sharing features. These extensions, together with an optimized shared memory parallelization and execution model, have been implemented in the ADAPTOR HPF compilation system and experimental results verify the efficiency of the chosen approach ", "keyword": "parallel programming; scalable shared memory; High Performance Fortran;;multiprocessor architectures; scalable hardware; shared memory;multiprocessor;", "title": "Efficient parallel programming on scalable shared memory systems with High \tPerformance Fortran"}

{"abstract": "High-Performance Fortran (HPF) was envisioned as a vehicle for modernizing legacy Fortran codes to achieve scalable parallel performance. To a large extent, today's commercially available HPF compilers have failed to deliver scalable parallel performance for a broad spectrum of applications because of insufficiently powerful compiler analysis and optimization. Substantial restructuring and hand-optimization can be required to achieve acceptable performance with an HPF port of an existing Fortran application, even for regular data-parallel applications. A key goal of the Rice dHPF compiler project has been to develop optimization techniques that enable a wide range of existing scientific applications to be ported easily to efficient HPF with minimal restructuring. This paper describes the challenges to effective parallelization presented by complex (but regular) data-parallel applications, and then describes how the novel analysis and optimization technologies in the dHPF compiler address these challenges effectively, without major rewriting of the applications. We illustrate the techniques by describing their use for parallelizing the NAS SP and BT benchmarks.

{"abstract": "OpenMP is emerging as a viable high-level programming model for shared memory parallel systems. It was conceived to enable easy, portable application development on this range of systems, and it has also been implemented on cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access (ccNUMA) architectures. Unfortunately, it is hard to obtain high performance on the latter architecture, particularly when large numbers of threads are involved. In this paper, we discuss the difficulties faced when writing OpenMP programs for ccNUMA systems, and explain how the vendors have attempted to overcome them. We focus on one such system, the SGI Origin 2000, and perform a variety of experiments designed to illustrate the impact of the vendor's efforts. We compare codes written in a standard, loop-level parallel style under OpenMP with alternative versions written in a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) fashion, also realized via OpenMP, and show that the latter consistently provides superior performance. A carefully chosen set of language extensions can help us translate programs from the former style to the latter (or to compile directly, but in a similar manner). Syntax for these extensions can be borrowed from HPF, and some aspects of HPF compiler technology can help the translation process.

An important aspect of portable performance is the behavior of the available HPF compilers. Ideally, a programmer may expect comparable performance between different HPF compilers, given the same program and the same machine. To test the performance portability between compilers, we have designed a special benchmark suite, called the TNO HPF benchmark suite. It consists of a set of HPF programs that test various aspects of efficient parallel code generation. The benchmark suite consists of a number of template programs that are used to generate test programs with different array sizes, alignments, distributions, and iteration spaces. It ranges from very simple assignments to more complex assignments such as triangular iteration spaces, convex iteration spaces, coupled subscripts, and indirection arrays. We have run the TNO HPF benchmark suite on three compilers: the PREPARE prototype compiler, the PGI-HPF compiler, and the GMD Adaptor HPF compiler. Results show performance differences that can be quite large (up to two orders of magnitude for the same test program).

{"abstract": "Discusses the factors that have made life difficult for consumer portal operators in recent years causing them, like others in the telecommunications, media and technology sector, to take a close look at their business models following the dot.com crash and the consequent reassessment of Internet-related project financing by the venture capital community. While the pressure is on to generate income from existing customers and users, portal operators must reach new markets and find realistic revenue streams. This search for real revenues has led to a move towards charging for content, a strategy being pursued by a large number of horizontal portal players, including MSN and Terra Lycos. This trend is particularly noticeable in China, where Chinadotcom operates a mainland portal and plans a range of fee-based services, including electronic mail. The nature of advertising itself is changing, with portals seeking blue-chip sponsorship and marketing deals that span a number of years. Players are struggling to redefine and reinvent themselves as a result of the changing environment and even the term \"portal\" is believed to be obsolete, partly due to its dot.com crash associations.

Describes how the Library came to terms with the need to integrate the Internet into its mainstream business information services, with particular reference to its limitations and to the provision of company information, market research, British Standards information, press cuttings and articles from specialized trade and scientific journals, and patents information. Focuses on some of the reasons why the public business library is still needed as a service to businesses, even after the introduction of the Internet and considers the Library's changing role and the need to impress on all concerned, especially government, the continuing value of these services. Looks to the partnerships formed by the Library over the years and the ways in which these are expected to assist in realizing future opportunities, in particular, the fact that all public libraries in England gained free Internet access at the end of 2001. Offers some useful ideas about how the Library could develop, noting that SINTO, a Sheffield based information network formed in 1938 and originally a partnership between the public library, the two Sheffield universities and various leading steel companies of the time, is being examined as a model for future services in Leeds.

{"abstract": "Given the ever-increasing scale and diversity of information and applications on the Internet, improving the technology of information retrieval is an urgent research objective. Retrieved information is either semi-structured or unstructured in format and its sources are extremely heterogeneous. In consequence, the task of efficiently gathering and extracting information from documents can be both difficult and tedious. Given this variety of sources and formats, many choose to use mediator/wrapper architecture, but its use demands a fast means of generating efficient wrappers. In this paper, we present a design for an automatic eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-based framework with which to generate wrappers rapidly. Wrappers created with this framework support a unified interface for a meta-search information retrieval system based on the Internet Search Service using the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard. Greatly advantaged by the compatibility of CORBA and XML, a user can quickly and easily develop information-gathering applications, such as a meta-search engine or any other information source retrieval method.

{"abstract": "Succession in standardization is often a problem. The advantages of improvements must be weighed against those of compatibility. If compatibility considerations dominate, a grafting process takes place. According to our taxonomy of succession, there are three types of outcomes. A Type I succession, where grafting is successful, entails compatibility between successors, technical paradigm compliance and continuity in the standards trajectory. In this paper, we examine issues of succession and focus on the Extensible Markup Language (XML). It was to be grafted on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a stable standard since 1988. However, XML was a profile, a subset and an extension of SGML (1988). Adaptation of SGML was needed (SGML 1999) to forge full (downward) compatibility with XML (1998). We describe the grafting efforts and analyze their outcomes. Our conclusion is that although SGML was a technical exemplar for XML developers, full compatibility was not achieved. The widespread use of HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) exemplified the desirability of simplicity in XML, standardization. This and HTML's user market largely explain the discontinuity in SGML-XML succession ", "keyword": "XML; SGML; standardization; grafting process; Type I succession; Extensible;Markup Language; Standard Generalized Markup Language;", "title": "Succession in standardization: grafting XML onto SGML"}
{"abstract": "Hypothetical reasoning is popular in fault diagnostics and design systems, but slow reasoning speed is its drawback. The goal of the current study is developing hypothetical reasoning based on an inference path network, which would overcome this drawback. In hypothetical reasoning systems based on an inference path network, there is much room for improvement regarding the computing costs of connotation processing and consistency checking. The authors of this study demonstrate improvement ideas regarding one of these problems, namely, consistency checking. First, the authors obtained necessary and sufficient conditions under which inconsistencies occur during hypothesis composition. Based on the obtained results, the authors proposed an algorithm for speeding up the process of consistency checking. Processing with this algorithm in its core consists of transforming the inference path network in such a way that inconsistencies do not occur during the hypothesis composition, under the condition of unchanged solution hypotheses.

{"abstract": "A similarity measure between cases is needed in order to evaluate the degree of similarity when using past similar cases in order to resolve current problems. In similar case retrieval, multiple indices are set up in order to characterize the queries and individual cases, then terms are given as values to each. The similarity measure between cases commonly used is defined using the rate at which the values provided from the corresponding indices match. In practice, however, values cannot be expected to be mutually exclusive. As a result, a natural expansion of this approach is to have relationships in which mutually similar meanings are reflected in the similarity measure between cases. In this paper the authors consider an auto-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between corresponding indices and a cross-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between mutually distinct indices, then defines a similarity measure between cases which considers the relationship of index values based on these thesauri. This definition satisfies the characteristics required for the operation of case-based retrieval even when one value is not necessarily given in the index.

{"abstract": "The authors describe the implementation, use, and performance evaluation of a FIFO queue class library by means of a high-performance, easy-to-use interface employed for queuing simulations in parallel discrete simulations based on the time warp method. Various general-purpose simulation libraries and languages have been proposed, and among these some have the advantage of not requiring users to define anything other than the state vector, and not needing awareness of rollback under a platform which performs state control based on copies. However, because the state vectors must be defined as simple data structures without pointers, dynamic data structures such as a FIFO queue cannot be handled directly. Under the proposed class library, both the platform and the user can handle such structures in the same fashion that embedded data structures are handled. In addition, instead of all stored data, just the operational history can be stored and recovered efficiently at an effectively minimal cost by taking advantage of the first-in-first-out characteristics of the above data structures.

This reduction is independent of the order of the filter, which is an advantage when the order of the filter is very large, and as a result the method can also be applied to infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. Furthermore, when the proposed method is compared with the transpose ADF, which has a filtering section with zero delay, it is realized that it significantly reduces the maximum delay associated with updating the coefficients of FIR ADF. The effect of this is that, the proposed method exhibits a higher convergence speed in comparison to the transpose FIR ADF ", "keyword": "pipelined FIR ADF; coefficient classification; adaptive digital filter; maximum;delay; delayed least mean square filter; pre-upsampled filter;;post-downsampled filter; convergence speed;", "title": "A new architecture for implementing pipelined FIR ADF based on classification \tof coefficients"}

In transcoding with a low compression ratio, it is crucial to prohibit transcoding with a requantization parameter which is 1 to 2 times the quantization parameter of the input stream. Consequently, as the first step, an optimization method for the requantization parameter is proposed which cares for the error propagation effect by interframe prediction. Then, the proposed optimization method is extended so that the method can also be applied to the case of a high compression ratio in which the rate-distortion curve is approximated for each macroblock in the range of requantization parameters larger than 2 times the quantization parameter.

Mainly, when values of attributes for a given customer, used in action rules, can not be easily changed by business user, definitions of these attributes are extracted from other sites of a distributed knowledge system. To be more precise, attributes at every site of a distributed knowledge system are divided into two sets: stable and flexible.

{"abstract": "This article introduces structural aspects in an ontology of approximate reason. The basic assumption in this ontology is that approximate reason is a capability of an agent. Agents are designed to classify information granules derived from sensors that respond to stimuli in the environment of an agent or received from other agents. Classification of information granules is carried out in the context of parameterized approximation spaces and a calculus of granules. Judgment in agents is a faculty of thinking about (classifying) the particular relative to decision rules derived from data. Judgment in agents is reflective, but not in the classical philosophical sense (e.g., the notion of judgment in Kant). In an agent, a reflective judgment itself is an assertion that a particular decision rule derived from data is applicable to an object (input). That is, a reflective judgment by an agent is an assertion that a particular vector of attribute (sensor) values matches to some degree the conditions for a particular rule. In effect, this form of judgment is an assertion that a vector of sensor values reflects a known property of data expressed by a decision rule. Since the reasoning underlying a reflective judgment is inductive and surjective (not based on a priori conditions or universals), this form of judgment is reflective, but not in the sense of Kant. Unlike Kant, a reflective judgment is surjective in the sense that it maps experimental attribute values onto the most closely matching descriptors (conditions) in a derived rule. Again, unlike Kant's notion of judgment, a reflective judgment is not the result of searching for a universal that pertains to a particular set of values of descriptors. Rather, a reflective judgment by an agent is a form of recognition that a particular vector of sensor values pertains to a particular rule in some degree. This recognition takes the form of an assertion that a particular descriptor vector is associated with a particular decision rule. These considerations can be repeated for other forms of classifiers besides those defined by decision rules ", "keyword": "ontology; approximate reason; information granules; parameterized approximation;spaces; granules; decision rules; reflective judgment; pattern;recognition; rough sets;", "title": "Towards an ontology of approximate reason"}

{"abstract": "The notions of an exact as well as a rough set are well-grounded as basic notions in rough set theory. They are however defined in the setting of a finite information system i.e. an information system having finite numbers of objects as well as attributes. In theoretical studies e.g. of topological properties of rough sets, one has to trespass this limitation and to consider information systems with potentially unbound number of attributes. In such setting, the notions of rough and exact sets may be defined in terms of topological operators of interior and closure with respect to an appropriate topology following the ideas from the finite case, where it is noticed that in the finite case rough-set-theoretic operators of lower and upper approximation are identical with the interior, respectively, closure operators in topology induced by equivalence classes of the indiscernibility relation. Extensions of finite information systems are also desirable from application point of view in the area of knowledge discovery and data mining, when demands of e.g. mass collaboration and/or huge experimental data call for need of working with large data tables so the sound theoretical generalization of these cases is an information system with the number of attributes not bound in advance by a fixed integer i.e. an information system with countably but infinitely many attributes, In large information systems, a need arises for qualitative measures of complexity of concepts involved free of parameters, cf. e.g. applications for the Vapnik-Czervonenkis dimension.

{"abstract": "A modified paradigm of computational steering (CS), termed visual design steering (VDS), is developed in this paper. The VDS paradigm is applied to optimal design problems to provide a means for capturing and enabling designer insights. VDS allows a designer to make decisions before, during or after an analysis or optimization via a visual environment, in order to effectively steer the solution process. The objective of VDS is to obtain a better solution in less time through the use of designer knowledge and expertise. Using visual representations of complex systems in this manner enables human experience and judgement to be incorporated into the optimal design process at appropriate steps, rather than having traditional black box solvers return solutions from a prescribed input set. Part I of this paper focuses on the research issues pertaining to the Graph Morphing visualization method created to represent an n-dimensional optimization problem using 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visualizations. Part II investigates the implementation of the VDS paradigm, using the graph morphing approach, to improve an optimal design process. Specifically, the following issues are addressed: impact of design variable changes on the optimal design space; identification of possible constraint redundancies; impact of constraint tolerances on the optimal solution: and smoothness of the objective function contours.

{"abstract": "Neurons are sensitive to correlations among synaptic inputs. However, analytical models that explicitly include correlations are hard to solve analytically, so their influence on a neuron's response has been difficult to ascertain. To gain some intuition on this problem, we studied the firing times of two simple integrate-and-fire model neurons driven by a correlated binary variable that represents the total input current. Analytic expressions were obtained for the average firing rate and coefficient of variation (a measure of spike-train variability) as functions of the mean, variance, and correlation time of the stochastic input. The results of computer simulations were in excellent agreement with these expressions. In these models, an increase in correlation time in general produces an increase in both the average firing rate and the variability of the output spike trains. However, the magnitude of the changes depends differentially on the relative values of the input mean and variance: the increase in firing rate is higher when the variance is large relative to the mean, whereas the increase in variability is higher when the variance is relatively small. In addition, the firing rate always tends to a finite limit value as the correlation time increases toward infinity, whereas the coefficient of variation typically diverges. These results suggest that temporal correlations may play a major role in determining the variability as well as the intensity of neuronal spike trains ", "keyword": "integrate-and-fire neurons; correlated stochastic input; synaptic input;correlations; firing times; correlated binary variable; coefficient of;variation; spike-train variability; computer simulation; output spike;trains; temporal correlations;", "title": "Integrate-and-fire neurons driven by correlated stochastic input"}

We investigate the effects of the noise filtering by synapses with various levels of realism on integrate-and-fire neuron dynamics. The noise input is modeled by white (for instantaneous synapses) or colored (for synapses with a finite relaxation time) noise. Analytical results for the modulation of firing probability in response to an oscillatory input current are obtained by expanding a Fokker-Planck equation for small parameters of the problem-when both the amplitude of the modulation is small compared to the background firing rate and the synaptic time constant is small compared to the membrane time constant. We report the detailed calculations showing that if a synaptic decay time constant is included in the synaptic current model, the firing-rate modulation of the neuron due to an oscillatory input remains finite in the high-frequency limit with no phase lag. In addition, we characterize the low-frequency behavior and the behavior of the high-frequency limit for intermediate decay times. We also characterize the effects of introducing a rise time to the synaptic currents and the presence of several synaptic receptors with different kinetics.

Proving in a mathematical sense that the linear model was correct would require ruling out all other possible models, a hopeless task.

{"abstract": "We outline a hybrid analog-digital scheme for computing with three important features that enable it to scale to systems of large complexity: First, like digital computation, which uses several one-bit precise logical units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation, the hybrid scheme uses several moderate-precision analog units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation. Second, frequent discrete signal restoration of the analog information prevents analog noise and offset from degrading the computation. Third, a state machine enables complex computations to be created using a sequence of elementary computations. A natural choice for implementing this hybrid scheme is one based on spikes because spike-count codes are digital, while spike-time codes are analog. We illustrate how spikes afford easy ways to implement all three components of scalable hybrid computation. First, as an important example of distributed analog computation, we show how spikes can create a distributed modular representation of an analog number by implementing digital carry interactions between spiking analog neurons. Second, we show how signal restoration may be performed by recursive spike-count quantization of spike-time codes. Third, we use spikes from an analog dynamical system to trigger state transitions in a digital dynamical system, which reconfigures the analog dynamical system using a binary control vector; such feedback interactions between analog and digital dynamical systems create a hybrid state machine (HSM). The HSM extends and expands the concept of a digital finite-state-machine to the hybrid domain. We present experimental data from a two-neuron HSM on a chip that implements error-correcting analog-to-digital conversion with the concurrent use of spike-time and spike-count codes. We also present experimental data from silicon circuits that implement HSM-based pattern recognition using spike-time synchrony.

We describe a method of measuring the size and lifetime of Internet streams, and use this method to characterize traffic distributions at two different sites. We find that although most streams (about 45 percent of them) are dragonflies, lasting less than 2 seconds, a significant number of streams have lifetimes of hours to days, and can carry a high proportion (50-60 percent) of the total bytes on a given link. We define tortoises as streams that last longer than 15 minutes. We point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime (dragonflies and tortoises) but also by size (mice and elephants), and note that stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions. We submit that ISPs need to be aware of the distribution of Internet stream sizes, and the impact of the difference in behavior between short and long streams. In particular, any forwarding cache mechanisms in Internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short streams. In addition ISPs should realize that long-running streams can contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumes-something they may not have allowed for when using traditional \"flat rate user bandwidth consumption\" approaches to provisioning and engineering ", "keyword": "Internet traffic streams; dragonflies; tortoises; network traffic streams;;Internet stream size measurement; Internet stream lifetime measurement;;traffic distributions; mice; elephants; ISP; forwarding cache;mechanisms; Internet routers; long-running streams; packet volume; byte;volume; traffic provisioning; traffic engineering;", "title": "Understanding Internet traffic streams: dragonflies and tortoises"}
{"abstract": "The performance of DSL systems is severely constrained by crosstalk due to the electromagnetic coupling among the multiple twisted pairs making up a phone cable. In order to reduce performance loss arising from crosstalk, DSL systems are currently designed under the assumption of worst-case crosstalk scenarios leading to overly conservative DSL deployments. This article presents a new paradigm for DSL system design, which takes into account the multi-user aspects of the DSL transmission environment. Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) departs from the current design philosophy by enabling transceivers to autonomously and dynamically optimize their communication settings with respect to both the channel and the transmissions of neighboring systems. Along with this distributed optimization, when an additional degree of coordination becomes available for future DSL deployment, DSM will allow even greater improvement in DSL performance. Implementations are readily applicable without causing any performance degradation to the existing DSLs under static spectrum management. After providing an overview of the DSM concept, this article reviews two practical DSM methods: iterative water-filling, an autonomous distributed power control method enabling great improvement in performance, which can be implemented through software options in some existing ADSL and VDSL systems; and vectored-DMT, a coordinated transmission/reception technique achieving crosstalk-free communication for DSL systems, which brings within reach the dream of providing universal Internet access at speeds close to 100 Mb/s to 500 m on 1-2 lines and beyond 1 km on 2-4 lines.

{"abstract": "The unprecedented growth of the Internet over the last years, and the expectation of an even faster increase in the numbers of users and networked systems, resulted in the Internet assuming its position as a mass communication medium. At the same time, the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance, or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols, with a variety of countermeasures, which, nonetheless, have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure.

{"abstract": "We present an approach to significantly enhance the spectral resolution of imaging systems by generalizing image mosaicing. A filter transmitting spatially varying spectral bands is rigidly attached to a camera. As the system moves, it senses each scene point multiple times, each time in a different spectral band. This is an additional dimension of the generalized mosaic paradigm, which has demonstrated yielding high radiometric dynamic range images in a wide field of view, using a spatially varying density filter. The resulting mosaic represents the spectrum at each scene point. The image acquisition is as easy as in traditional image mosaics. We derive an efficient scene sampling rate, and use a registration method that accommodates the spatially varying properties of the filter. Using the data acquired by this method, we demonstrate scene rendering under different simulated illumination spectra. We are also able to infer information about the scene illumination. The approach was tested using a standard 8-bit black/white video camera and a fixed spatially varying spectral (interference) filter ", "keyword": "generalized mosaicing; wide field of view multispectral imaging; spatially;varying spectral bands; spatially varying density filter; image;acquisition; scene sampling rate; registration method; scene rendering;;simulated illumination spectra; scene illumination; hyperspectral;imaging; color balance; image fusion; physics-based vision; image-based;rendering;", "title": "Generalized mosaicing: wide field of view multispectral imaging"}

We analytically construct the principal component analysis for images of a convex Lambertian object, explicitly taking attached shadows into account, and find the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues with respect to lighting variability. Our analysis makes use of an analytic formula for the irradiance in terms of spherical-harmonic coefficients of the illumination and shows, under appropriate assumptions, that the principal components or eigenvectors are identical to the spherical harmonic basis functions evaluated at the surface normal vectors. Our main contribution is in extending these results to the single-viewpoint case, showing how the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues are affected when only a limited subset (the upper hemisphere) of normals is available and the spherical harmonics are no longer orthonormal over the restricted domain. Our results are very close, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to previous empirical observations and represent the first essentially complete theoretical explanation of these observations ", "keyword": "analytic principal component analysis; spherical harmonics; lighting;variability; five-dimensional subspace; convex Lambertian object;;surface normal vectors; principal eigenmodes; principal eigenvalues;;radiance; irradiance;", "title": "Analytic PCA construction for theoretical analysis of lighting variability in \timages of a Lambertian object"}
{"abstract": "We present a technique for the automatic adaptation of a deformable model's elastic parameters within a Kalman filter framework for shape estimation applications. The novelty of the technique is that the model's elastic parameters are not constant, but spatio-temporally varying. The variation of the elastic parameters depends on the distance of the model from the data and the rate of change of this distance. Each pass of the algorithm uses physics-based modeling techniques to iteratively adjust both the geometric and the elastic degrees of freedom of the model in response to forces that are computed from the discrepancy between the model and the data. By augmenting the state equations of an extended Kalman filter to incorporate these additional variables, we are able to significantly improve the quality of the shape estimation. Therefore, the model's elastic parameters are always initialized to the same value and they are subsequently modified depending on the data and the noise distribution. We present results demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional data ", "keyword": "elastically adaptive deformable models; automatic adaptation; elastic;parameters; Kalman filter framework; shape estimation; physics-based;modeling techniques; geometric degrees of freedom; elastic degrees of;freedom; state equations; extended Kalman filter;", "title": "Elastically adaptive deformable models"}

Furthermore, the performance of efficiency oriented, exhaustive, group scheduling heuristics deteriorated while the performance of the more complex, non-exhaustive heuristics improved.

Good examples of production systems that allow for batch processing are ovens found in the aircraft industry and in semiconductor manufacturing. In this paper we study the issue of dynamic scheduling of such systems within the context of multi-stage flow shops. So far, a great deal of research has concentrated on the development of control strategies, which only address the batch stage. This paper proposes an integral scheduling approach that also includes succeeding stages. In this way, we aim for shop optimization, instead of optimizing performance for a single stage. Our so-called look-ahead strategy adapts its scheduling decision to shop status, which includes information on a limited number of near-future arrivals. In particular, we study a two-stage flow shop, in which the batch stage is succeeded by a serial stage. The serial stage may be realized by a single machine or by parallel machines. Through an extensive simulation study it is demonstrated how shop performance can be improved by the proposed strategy relative to existing strategies ", "keyword": "adaptive scheduling; batch servers; flow shops; batch servicing; manufacturing;operations; production systems; ovens; aircraft industry; semiconductor;manufacturing; dynamic scheduling; multi-stage flow shops; control;strategies; integral scheduling approach; shop optimization; look-ahead;strategy; near-future arrivals; two-stage flow shop; single machine;;parallel machines; simulation study;", "title": "Adaptive scheduling of batch servers in flow shops"}
{"abstract": "A method of generating NC programs for the high-speed milling of moulds is investigated. Forging dies and injection moulds, whether plastic or aluminium, have a complex surface geometry. In addition they are made of steels of hardness as much as 30 or even 50 HRC. Since 1995, high-speed machining has been much adopted by the die-making industry, which with this technology can reduce its use of Sinking Electrodischarge Machining (SEDM). EDM, in general, calls for longer machining times. The use of high-speed machining makes it necessary to redefine the preliminary stages of the process. In addition, it affects the methodology employed in the generation of NC programs, which requires the use of high-level CAM software. The aim is to generate error-free programs that make use of optimum cutting strategies in the interest of productivity and surface quality. The final result is a more reliable manufacturing process. There are two risks in the use of high-speed milling on hardened steels. One of these is tool breakage, which may be very costly and may furthermore entail marks on the workpiece. The other is collisions between the tool and the workpiece or fixtures, the result of which may be damage to the ceramic bearings in the spindles. in order to minimize these risks it is necessary that new control and optimization steps be included in the CAM methodology. There are three things that the firm adopting high-speed methods should do. It should redefine its process engineering, it should systematize access by its CAM programmers to high-speed knowhow, and it should take up the use of process simulation tools. In the latter case, it will be very advantageous to use tools for the estimation of cutting forces. The new work methods proposed in this article have made it possible to introduce high speed milling (HSM) into the die industry.

Owing to the difficulty of the resulting arc-routing problems, effective local search heuristics are developed. Computational speed becomes important because robot arc welding is often part of an automated process-planning procedure. Generating a reasonable solution in an acceptable time is necessary for effective automated process planning. Several different heuristics are proposed for solving the welding task-sequencing problem considering both productivity and the potential for welding distortion.

{"abstract": "The machining of complex parts typically involves a logical and chronological sequence of n operations on m machine tools. Because manufacturing datums cannot always match design constraints, some of the design specifications imposed on the part are usually satisfied by distinct subsets of the n operations prescribed in the process plan. Conventional tolerance control specifies a fixed set point for each operation and a permissible variation about this set point to insure compliance with the specifications, whereas sequential tolerance control (STC) uses real-time measurement information at the completion of one stage to reposition the set point for subsequent operations. However, it has been shown that earlier sphere-fitting methods for STC can lead to inferior solutions when the process distributions are skewed. This paper introduces an extension of STC that uses an adaptive sphere-fitting method that significantly improves the yield in the presence of skewed distributions as well as significantly reducing the computational effort required by earlier probabilistic search methods ", "keyword": "machine tools; sequential tolerance control; adaptive sphere-fitting method;;design constraints; compliance; real-time measurement information;;yield improvement; skewed distributions; computational effort;", "title": "An adaptive sphere-fitting method for sequential tolerance control"}
{"abstract": "This paper addresses the deadlock-free scheduling problem in Flexible Manufacturing Systems. An efficient deadlock-free scheduling algorithm was developed, using timed Petri nets, for a class of FMSs called Systems of Sequential Systems with Shared Resources (S/sup 4/ R). The algorithm generates a partial reachability graph to find the optimal or near-optimal deadlock-free schedule in terms of the firing sequence of the transitions of the Petri net model. The objective is to minimize the mean flow time (MFT). An efficient truncation technique, based on the siphon concept, has been developed and used to generate the minimum necessary portion of the reachability graph to be searched. It has been shown experimentally that the developed siphon truncation technique enhances the ability to develop deadlock-free schedules of systems with a high number of deadlocks, which cannot be achieved using standard Petri net scheduling approaches. It may be necessary, in some cases, to relax the optimality condition for large FMSs in order to make the search effort reasonable. Hence, a User Control Factor (UCF) was defined and used in the scheduling algorithm. The objective of using the UCF is to achieve an acceptable trade-off between the solution quality and the search effort. Its effect on the MFT and the CPU time has been investigated. Randomly generated examples are used for illustration and comparison. Although the effect of UCF did not affect the mean flow time, it was shown that increasing it reduces the search effort (CPU time) significantly ", "keyword": "flexible manufacturing systems; deadlock-free scheduling; Petri nets; systems;of sequential systems with shared resources; partial reachability;graph; optimal deadlock-free schedule; near-optimal deadlock-free;schedule; Petri net model transitions firing sequence; mean flow time;minimization; siphon truncation technique; optimality condition;relaxation; user control factor; CPU time; randomly generated examples;", "title": "Deadlock-free scheduling in flexible manufacturing systems using Petri nets"}

{"abstract": "Pull-in parameters are important properties of electrostatic actuators. Efficient and accurate analysis tools that can capture these parameters for different design geometries, are therefore essential. Current simulation tools approach the pull-in state by iteratively adjusting the voltage applied across the actuator electrodes. The convergence rate of this scheme gradually deteriorates as the pull-in state is approached. Moreover, the convergence is inconsistent and requires many mesh and accuracy refinements to assure reliable predictions. As a result, the design procedure of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices can be time-consuming. In this paper a novel Displacement Iteration Pull-In Extraction (DIPIE) scheme is presented. The DIPIE scheme is shown to converge consistently and far more rapidly than the Voltage Iterations (VI) scheme (>100 times faster!). The DIPIE scheme requires separate mechanical and electrostatic field solvers. Therefore, it can be easily implemented in existing MOEMS CAD packages.

Instead, the manuals were developed directly from the digital information used to produce the existing paper manual. Usability trials were carried out to test both versions according to the time taken and errors committed by users during typical information retrieval tasks. Users were questioned to determine their ease of use (EOU) perceptions for each manual. The main outcomes were that the navigation aid used in the second version reduced the time taken to use the manual but increased the number of errors made by users. The navigational aid also seemed to reduce the perceived EOU compared with the first version.

As a result, WebHotLine helps to save cost in eliminating the expensive overseas telephone charges, reduction in machine down time and number of on-site visits by service engineers as in traditional helpdesk environment ", "keyword": "Web-based intelligent helpdesk-support environment; Internet technology;;WebHotLine; customer service centre; Web-based fault information;retrieval; online multilingual translation capability;;videoconferencing;", "title": "Web-based intelligent helpdesk-support environment"}
{"abstract": "This paper presents an optical actuation scheme for MEMS devices based on the well-established fact that light possesses momentum, and hence, imparts a force equal to 2 W/c when reflected by a surface. Here, W is the total power of the reflected light, and c is the speed of light. Radiation pressure, as it is known, is nearly insignificant for most macroscale applications, but it can be quite significant for MEMS devices. In addition, light actuation offers a new paradigm. First, intersecting light beams do not interfere, in contrast to electrical conductors, which short when they come into contact. Second, light can operate in high temperature and high radiation environments far outside the capability of solid state electronic components. This actuation method is demonstrated, both in air and in vacuum, by switching the state of a bistable MEMS device. The associated heat transfer model is also presented ", "keyword": "bistable MEMS; optical actuation scheme; radiation pressure; MEMS devices;;intersecting light beams; high temperature environments; high radiation;environments; heat transfer model;", "title": "Optical actuation of a bistable MEMS"}
{"abstract": "Several extensions and improvements to surface merging procedures based on the extraction of isosurfaces from a distance map defined on an adaptive background grid are presented. The main objective is to extend the application of these algorithms to surfaces with sharp edges and comers. In order to deal with objects of different length scales, the initial background grids are created using a Delaunay triangulation method and local voxelizations. A point enrichment technique that introduces points into the background grid along detected surface features such as ridges is used to ensure that these features are preserved in the final merged surface. The surface merging methodology is extended to include other Boolean operations between surface triangulations. The iso-surface extraction algorithms are modified to obtain the correct iso-surface for multi-component objects. The procedures are demonstrated with various examples, ranging from simple geometrical entities to complex engineering applications. The present algorithms allow realistic modelling of a large number of complex engineering geometries using overlapping components defined discretely, i.e. via surface triangulations. This capability is very useful for grid generation starting from data originated in measurements or images ", "keyword": "feature-preserving volumetric technique; merge surface triangulations; surface;merging procedures; iso-surfaces extraction; multi-component objects;;simple geometrical entities; complex engineering applications;;overlapping components; images; mesh generation; unstructured grids;;discrete data; surface intersection; geometric modelling; adaptive;background grid; sharp edges; sharp comers; Delaunay triangulation;method; local voxelizations; point enrichment technique background;grid; ridges; Boolean operations; surface triangulations; arterial;surfaces; haemoglobin molecule;", "title": "A feature-preserving volumetric technique to merge surface triangulations"}
{"abstract": "Based on the understanding of existing spatial digital tree-based contact detection approaches, and the alternating digital tree (ADT) algorithm in particular, a more efficient algorithm, termed the augmented spatial digital tree (ASDT) algorithm, is proposed in the present work. The ASDT algorithm adopts a different point representation scheme that uses only the lower comer vertex to represent a (hyper-)rectangle, with the upper comer vertex serving as the augmented information. Consequently, the ASDT algorithm can keep the working space the same as the original n-dimensional space and, in general, a much better balanced tree can be expected. This, together with the introduction of an additional bounding subregion for the rectangles associated with each tree node, makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of node visits in the region search, although each node visit may be slightly more expensive. Three examples arising in computational mechanics are presented to provide an assessment of the performance of the ASDT. The numerical results indicate that the ASDT is, at least, over 3.9 times faster than the ADT ", "keyword": "augmented spatial digital tree algorithm; contact detection; computational;mechanics; alternating digital tree algorithm; upper comer vertex;;augmented data structure; spatial binary tree-based contact detection;approaches;", "title": "An augmented spatial digital tree algorithm for contact detection in \tcomputational mechanics"}
{"abstract": "In this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing the flow of values and their reuse in loop nests to minimize data traffic under the constraints of limited on-chip memory capacity and dependences. Our analysis first undertakes fusion of possible loop nests intra-procedurally and then performs loop distribution. The analysis discovers the closeness factor of two statements which is a quantitative measure of data traffic saved per unit memory occupied if the statements were under the same loop nest over the case where they are under different loop nests. We then develop a greedy algorithm which traverses the program dependence graph to group statements together under the same loop nest legally to promote maximal reuse per unit of memory occupied. We implemented our framework in Petit, a tool for dependence analysis and loop transformations. We compared our method with one based on tiling of fused loop nest and one based on a greedy strategy to purely maximize reuse. We show that our methods work better than both of these strategies in most cases for processors such as TMS320Cxx, which have a very limited amount of on-chip memory. The improvements in data I/O range from 10 to 30 percent over tiling and from 10 to 40 percent over maximal reuse for JPEG loops ", "keyword": "loop restructuring; data I/O minimization; on-chip memory; data traffic;;embedded processors; loop fusion; data locality; program dependence;graph; Petit; fused loop nest; closeness factor; DSP;", "title": "Loop restructuring for data I/O minimization on limited on-chip memory embedded \tprocessors"}
{"abstract": "Database broadcast is an effective and scalable approach to disseminate information of high affinity to a large collection of mobile clients. A common problem of existing broadcast approaches is the lack of knowledge for a client to determine if all data items satisfying its query could be obtained from the broadcast. We therefore propose a semantic-based broadcast approach. A semantic descriptor is attached to each broadcast unit, called a data chunk. This semantic descriptor allows a client to determine if a query can be answered entirely based on broadcast items and, if needed, identify the precise definition of the remaining items in the form of a \"supplementary\" query. Data chunks can be of static or dynamic sizes and organized hierarchically. Their boundary can be determined on-the-fly, adaptive to the nature of client queries. We investigate different ways of organizing the data chunks over a broadcast channel to improve access performance. We introduce the data affinity index metric, which more accurately reflects client-perceived performance. A simulation model is built to evaluate our semantic-based broadcast schemes ", "keyword": "mobile databases; mobile computing; semantic data broadcast; mobile clients;;semantic descriptor; data chunking; query processing; data affinity;index; adaptive chunking; answerability;", "title": "Semantic data broadcast for a mobile environment based on dynamic and adaptive \tchunking"}

The application domain of data broadcast will be widely expanded in the near future, where the client is expected to perform complex queries or transactions on the broadcast data. To reduce the access latency for processing the complex query, it is beneficial to place the data accessed in a query close to each other on the broadcast channel. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to determine the allocation of the data on the broadcast channel such that frequently co-accessed data are not only allocated close to each other, but also in a particular order which optimizes the performance of query processing. Our mechanism is based on the well-known problem named optimal linear ordering.

{"abstract": "Mobile location-dependent information services (LDISs) have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, data caching strategies for LDISs have thus far received little attention. In this paper, we study the issues of cache invalidation and cache replacement for location-dependent data under a geometric location model. We introduce a new performance criterion, called caching efficiency, and propose a generic method for location-dependent cache invalidation strategies. In addition, two cache replacement policies, PA and PAID, are proposed. Unlike the conventional replacement policies, PA and PAID take into consideration the valid scope area of a data value. We conduct a series of simulation experiments to study the performance of the proposed caching schemes. The experimental results show that the proposed location-dependent invalidation scheme is very effective and the PA and PAID policies significantly outperform the conventional replacement policies ", "keyword": "mobile computing; location-dependent information; cache replacement; cache;invalidation; semantic caching; performance evaluation; mobile;location-dependent information services; data caching;", "title": "Cache invalidation and replacement strategies for location-dependent data in \tmobile environments"}

Understanding hydrogel properties is also important from the standpoint of their similarity to many biological tissues. Typically, gel size is sensitive to outer solution pH and salt concentration. In this paper, we develop models to predict the swelling/deswelling of hydrogels in buffered pH solutions. An equilibrium model has been developed to predict the degree of swelling of the hydrogel at a given pH and salt concentration in the solution. A kinetic model has been developed to predict the rate of swelling of the hydrogel when the solution pH is changed. Experiments are performed to characterize the mechanical properties of the hydrogel in different pH solutions. The degree of swelling as well as the rate of swelling of the hydrogel are also studied through experiments.

{"abstract": "Double sampling (DS) X-control charts are designed to allow quick detection of a small shift of process mean and provides a quick response in an agile manufacturing environment. However, the DS X-control charts assume that the process standard deviation remains unchanged throughout the entire course of the statistical process control.

In this paper, the development of the DS s-charts for quickly detecting small shift in process standard deviation for agile manufacturing is presented. The construction of the DS s-charts is based on the same concepts in constructing the DS X-charts and is formulated as an optimization problem and solved with a genetic algorithm. The efficiency of the DS s-control chart is compared with that of the traditional s-control chart. The results show that the DS s-control charts can be a more economically preferable alternative in detecting small shifts than traditional s-control charts ", "keyword": "double sampling s-control charts; agile manufacturing; double sampling;X-control charts; process mean shift detection; process standard;deviation; statistical process control; genetic algorithm;", "title": "Construction of double sampling s-control charts for agile manufacturing"}

{"abstract": "Analytical phantoms are used to generate projection data for testing reconstruction accuracy in computed axial tomography. A circular source locus (equivalent to rotating specimen with a fixed source) provides insufficient data for 'exact' reconstruction in cone-beam transmission tomography, thus phantom data are useful for studying the consequent errors and also for investigating alternative scanning loci and reconstruction techniques. We present an algorithm that can compute phantom cone-beam projection data from a phantom comprising geometrically defined polyhedra. Each polyhedron is defined as a set of polygons enclosing a volume of fixed linear attenuation coefficient. The algorithm works by projecting each polygon in turn onto the modelled detector array, which accumulates the product of source to polygon intersection distance (for the rays intersecting each detector element), linear attenuation coefficient and sign of projected polygon area (indicating whether rays enter or exit the polyhedron at this face). The phantom data are rotated according to the projection angle, whilst the source location and detector plane remain fixed. Polyhedra can be of simple geometric form, or complex surfaces derived from 3D images of real specimens.

An image processing program was developed to enhance and segment the flow image, and then to identify the particles. Over 90% of all the particles can be identified and located from the partially overlapped particle images using the circular Hough transform. Then the 3D position of each detected particle was determined by matching its front view image to its side view image. The particle velocity was then obtained by pairing its images in successive video fields. The measurements for the spherical expanded polystyrene particle-oil flows show that the particles, like the spherical bubbles in laminar bubbly flows, tend to conglomerate near the pipe wall and to line up to form the particle clusters.

{"abstract": "Every C++ program that uses inheritance must manage memory somehow. The most obvious way to do so is directly, but programmers who create complicated data structures often have trouble figuring out what parts of those data structures are safe to delete when. The classical method of dealing with such complexity is to hide it in a class. Such classes are typically called handles; the idea is to attach a handle object to another object that contains the actual data. The simplest form of a handle, which we have discussed in this article, is one in which each handle object corresponds to a single object from the inheritance hierarchy. Such handles are straightforward to use and to implement and tend to be intrinsically exception safe in almost all respects. The one exception hazard in such a class is typically the assignment operator. Assignment operators often test for self-assignment to avoid aliasing problems. As Herb Sutter has observed (2000), programs that need such tests are almost always exception unsafe. By rewriting the assignment operator, we ensure that we do not do anything irrevocable until the possibility of throwing an exception has passed. This strategy ensures that if an exception occurs while our assignment operator is executing, we do not corrupt the rest of our system ", "keyword": "handles; assignment operator; self-assignment; aliasing problems; exception;;C++ program; inheritance hierarchy;", "title": "Handles and exception safety, Part 1.

{"abstract": "The C++ Standard states that a union type cannot have a member with a nontrivial constructor or destructor. While at first this seems unreasonable, further thought makes it clear why this is the case: The crux of the problem is that unions don't have built-in semantics for denoting when a member is the \"current\" member of the union. Therefore, the compiler can't know when it's appropriate to call constructors or destructors on the union members. Still, there are good reasons for wanting to use constructed object types in a union. For example, you might want to implement a scripting language with a single variable type that can either be an integer, a string, or a list. A union is the perfect candidate for implementing such a composite type, but the restriction on constructed union members may prevent you from using an existing string or list class (for example, from the STL) to provide the underlying functionality.

{"abstract": "Practical experience has taught many Java developers one thing: critical resources (mutexes, database connections, transactions, file handles, etc.) require timely and systematic release. Unfortunately, Java's garbage collector is not up to that job.

Even more unfortunately, Java's counterpart to the C++ destructor (the finally block) is both tedious and error-prone, requiring developers to constantly remember and duplicate resource-releasing code. Consequently, even good Java developers can forget to release critical resources. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.

{"abstract": "The teaching of electronic commerce in universities has become a growth industry in itself. The rapid expansion of electronic commerce programmes raises the question of what actually is being taught. The association of electronic commerce as primarily a technical or information technology (IT) phenomenon has not been sufficient to constrain it to IT and information systems departments. Business schools have been keen entrants into the electronic commerce coursework race and they are developing electronic commerce programmes in an environment where there is no agreed definition of the term. This paper draws on the work of Kenneth Boulding who argued that the dynamics of change in society are largely a product of changing skills and the way these skills are arranged into roles at the organizational level. It is argued that an overly technical interpretation of electronic commerce narrows the skills being acquired as part of formal education. Universities, under pressure from the market and technological change, are changing their roles resulting in a further narrowing of the breadth of issues that is seen as legitimate to be included as electronic commerce. The outcome is that aspiring electronic commerce professionals are not being exposed to a wide enough agenda of ideas and concepts that will assist them to make better business decisions ", "keyword": "electronic commerce professionals; universities; information technology; IT;;information systems; business schools; management education standards;improvement; organizational level; formal education; Kenneth Boulding;", "title": "Raising the standard of management education for electronic commerce \tprofessionals"}

It takes a look at the features offered by the RedBoot ROM monitor and sees how it can be configured. It also walks through the steps of rebuilding and installing a new RedBoot image on a target platform. Finally, it looks at future enhancements that are coming in new releases and how to get support and additional information when using RedBoot.

In the paper, element matrices and solution procedures for the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) are derived.

{"abstract": "The quantification of perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI (DSC-MRI) requires deconvolution to obtain the residual impulse response function (IRF). In this work, a method using the Gaussian process for deconvolution (GPD) is proposed. The fact that the IRF is smooth is incorporated as a constraint in the method. The GPD method, which automatically estimates the noise level in each voxel, has the advantage that model parameters are optimized automatically. The GPD is compared to singular value decomposition (SVD) using a common threshold for the singular values, and to SVD using a threshold optimized according to the noise level in each voxel. The comparison is carried out using artificial data as well as data from healthy volunteers. It is shown that GPD is comparable to SVD with a variable optimized threshold when determining the maximum of the IRF, which is directly related to the perfusion. GPD provides a better estimate of the entire IRF. As the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases or the time resolution of the measurements increases, GPD is shown to be superior to SVD.

Patients were administered a battery of outcome measures assessing eating disorders symptomathology, attitudes toward food, body dissatisfaction, level of anxiety, motivation for change, level of assertiveness, and general psychiatric symptoms. In the short term, the VR treatment was more effective than the traditional cognitive-behavioral psychonutritional groups in improving the overall psychological state of the patients. In particular, the therapy was more effective in improving body satisfaction, self-efficacy, and motivation for change. No significant differences were found in the reduction of the binge eating behavior.

{"abstract": "The great potential offered by virtual reality (VR) to clinical psychologists derives prevalently from the central role, in psychotherapy, occupied by the imagination and by memory. These two elements, which are fundamental in our life, present absolute and relative limits to the individual potential. Using VR as an advanced imaginal system, an experience that is able to reduce the gap existing between imagination and reality, it is possible to transcend these limits. In this sense, VR can improve the efficacy of a psychological therapy for its capability of reducing the distinction between the computer's reality and the conventional reality. Two are the core characteristics of this synthetic imaginal experience: the perceptual illusion of nonmediation and the possibility of building and sharing a common ground. In this sense, experiencing presence in a clinical virtual environment (VE), such as a shared virtual hospital, requires more than reproduction of the physical features of external reality.

{"abstract": "The opening of voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels has a steep relationship with voltage. In response to changes in the transmembrane voltage, structural movements of an ion channel that precede channel opening generate a capacitative gating current. The net gating charge displacement due to membrane depolarization is an index of the voltage sensitivity of the ion channel activation process. Understanding the molecular basis of voltage-dependent gating of ion channels requires the measurement and computation of the gating charge, Q. We derive a simple and accurate semianalytic approach to computing the voltage dependence of transient gating charge movement (Q-V relationship) of discrete Markov state models of ion channels using matrix methods. This approach allows rapid computation of Q-V curves for finite and infinite length step depolarizations and is consistent with experimentally measured transient gating charge.

{"abstract": "We present a reduction of a large-scale network model of visual cortex developed by McLaughlin, Shapley, Shelley, and Wielaard. The reduction is from many integrate-and-fire neurons to a spatially coarse-grained system for firing rates of neuronal subpopulations. It accounts explicitly for spatially varying architecture, ordered cortical maps (such as orientation preference) that vary regularly across the cortical layer, and disordered cortical maps (such as spatial phase preference or stochastic input conductances) that may vary widely from cortical neuron to cortical neuron. The result of the reduction is a set of nonlinear spatiotemporal integral equations for \"phase-averaged\" firing rates of neuronal subpopulations across the model cortex, derived asymptotically from the full model without the addition of any extra phenomological constants. This reduced system is used to study the response of the model to drifting grating stimuli - where it is shown to be useful for numerical investigations that reproduce, at far less computational cost, the salient features of the point-neuron network and for analytical investigations that unveil cortical mechanisms behind the responses observed in the simulations of the large-scale computational model. For example, the reduced equations clearly show (1) phase averaging as the source of the time-invariance of cortico-cortical conductances, (2) the mechanisms in the model for higher firing rates and better orientation selectivity of simple cells which are near pinwheel centers, (3) the effects of the length-scales of cortico-cortical coupling, and (4) the role of noise in improving the contrast invariance of orientation selectivity ", "keyword": "large-scale network model; visual cortex; neuronal networks; coarse-graining;;point-neuron network; phase-averaged firing rates; nonlinear;spatiotemporal integral equations; dynamics; orientation selectivity;", "title": "Coarse-grained reduction and analysis of a network model of cortical response: \tI.

{"abstract": "Profiled edge lamination (PEL) tooling is a promising rapid tooling (RT) method involving the assembly of an array of laminations whose top edges are simultaneously profiled and beveled based on a CAD model of the intended tool surface. To facilitate adoption of this RT method by industry, a comprehensive PEL tooling development system is proposed. The two main parts of this system are: (1) iterative tool design based on thermal and structural models; and (2) fabrication of the tool using a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software and abrasive water jet cutting. CAM software has been developed to take lamination slice data (profiles) from any proprietary RP software in the form of polylines and create smooth, kinematically desirable cutting trajectories for each tool lamination. Two cutting trajectory algorithms, called identical equidistant profile segmentation and adaptively vector profiles projection (AVPP), were created for this purpose. By comparing the performance of both algorithms with a benchmark part shape, the AVPP algorithm provided better cutting trajectories for complicated tool geometries.

{"abstract": "Temperatures are of interest in machining because cutting tools often fail by thermal softening or temperature-activated wear. Many models for cutting temperatures have been developed, but these models consider only simple tool geometries such as a rectangular slab with a sharp corner. This report describes a finite element study of tool temperatures in cutting that accounts for tool nose radius and included angle effects. A temperature correction factor model that can be used in the design and selection of inserts is developed to account for these effects. A parametric mesh generator is used to generate the finite element models of tool and inserts of varying geometries. The steady-state temperature response is calculated using NASTRAN solver. Several finite element analysis (FEA) runs are performed to quantify the effects of inserts included angle, nose radius, and materials for the insert and the tool holder on the cutting temperature at the insert rake face. The FEA results are then utilized to develop a temperature correction factor model that accounts for these effects. The temperature correction factor model is integrated with an analytical temperature model for rectangular inserts to predict cutting temperatures for contour turning with inserts of various shapes and nose radii. Finally, experimental measurements of cutting temperature using the tool-work thermocouple technique are performed and compared with the predictions of the new temperature model.

Two experimental methods have been suggested in the past to extract the ploughing (non-cutting) component from the total measured force: (1) the extrapolation approach, and (2) the dwell force technique. This study reports the behavior of zinc during orthogonal machining using tools of controlled edge radius. Applications of both the extrapolation and dwell approaches show that neither produces an analysis that yields a material response consistent with the known behavior of zinc. Further analysis shows that the edge geometry modifies the shear zone of the material and thereby modifies the forces. When analyzed this way, the measured force data yield the expected material response without requiring recourse to an additional ploughing component ", "keyword": "tool edge geometry; cutting tool; metal cutting; ploughing component;;extrapolation; dwell force; zinc; edge geometry; orthogonal machining;", "title": "Application of an internally consistent material model to determine the effect \tof tool edge geometry in orthogonal machining"}
{"abstract": "This paper presents methods for speaker adaptive modeling using vocal tract normalization (VTN) along with experimental tests on three databases. We propose a new training method for VTN: By using single-density acoustic models per HMM state for selecting the scale factor of the frequency axis, we avoid the problem that a mixture-density tends to learn the scale factors of the training speakers and thus cannot be used for selecting the scale factor. We show that using single Gaussian densities for selecting the scale factor in training results in lower error rates than using mixture densities. For the recognition phase, we propose an improvement of the well-known two-pass strategy: by using a non-normalized acoustic model for the first recognition pass instead of a normalized model, lower error rates are obtained. In recognition tests, this method is compared with a fast variant of VTN. The two-pass strategy is an efficient method, but it is suboptimal because the scale factor and the word sequence are determined sequentially. We found that for telephone digit string recognition this suboptimality reduces the VTN gain in recognition performance by 30% relative.

{"abstract": "This paper introduces a new statistical approach, namely the probabilistic union model, for speech recognition involving partial, unknown frequency-band corruption. Partial frequency-band corruption accounts for the effect of a family of real-world noises. Previous methods based on the missing feature theory usually require the identity of the noisy bands. This identification can be difficult for unexpected noise with unknown, time-varying band characteristics. The new model combines the local frequency-band information based on the union of random events, to reduce the dependence of the model on information about the noise. This model partially accomplishes the target: offering robustness to partial frequency-band corruption, while requiring no information about the noise. This paper introduces the theory and implementation of the union model, and is focused on several important advances. These new developments include a new algorithm for automatic order selection, a generalization of the modeling principle to accommodate partial feature stream corruption, and a combination of the union model with conventional noise reduction techniques to deal with a mixture of stationary noise and unknown, nonstationary noise. For the evaluation, we used the TIDIGITS database for speaker-independent connected digit recognition.

Some special cases of this formula lead to classical results known from the literature, others are new. This formula is recursive in nature, and uses only the instantaneous values of the two signals, in a low-cost and low-complexity manner; in particular, there is no need to take square roots or to carry out divisions. Furthermore, this formula can be modified with respect to the occurrence of the two signals so as to further decrease the complexity, and increase ease of implementation. The latter modification comes at the expense that not the actual correlation is tracked, but, rather, a somewhat deformed version of it. To overcome this problem, we propose, for a number of instances of the tracking formula, a simple warping operation on the deformed correlation. Now we obtain, at least for sinusoidal signals, the correct value of the correlation coefficient. Special attention is paid to the convergence behavior of the algorithm for stationary signals and the dynamic behavior if there is a transition to another stationary state; the latter is considered to be important to study the tracking abilities to nonstationary signals. We illustrate tracking algorithm by using it for stereo music fragments, obtained from a number of digital audio recordings ", "keyword": "efficient tracking; cross-correlation coefficient; audio processing algorithms;;discrete-time signals; time-dependent correlation; recursive formula;;warping operation; deformed correlation; sinusoidal signals;;convergence behavior; stationary signals; dynamic behavior; stationary;state; nonstationary signals; tracking algorithm; stereo music;fragments; digital audio recording;", "title": "Efficient tracking of the cross-correlation coefficient"}

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a versatile perceptual audio coding method that achieves high compression ratios and is capable of low encoding/decoding delay. It accommodates a variety of source signals (including both music and speech) with different sampling rates. It is based on separating irrelevance and redundancy reductions into independent functional units. This contrasts traditional audio coding where both are integrated within the same subband decomposition. The separation allows for the independent optimization of the irrelevance and redundancy reduction units. For both reductions, we rely on adaptive filtering and predictive coding as much as possible to minimize the delay. A psycho-acoustically controlled adaptive linear filter is used for the irrelevance reduction, and the redundancy reduction is carried out by a predictive lossless coding scheme, which is termed weighted cascaded least mean squared (WCLMS) method. Experiments are carried out on a database of moderate size which contains mono-signals of different sampling rates and varying nature (music, speech, or mixed). They show that the proposed WCLMS lossless coder outperforms other competing lossless coders in terms of compression ratios and delay, as applied to the pre-filtered signal. Moreover, a subjective listening test of the combined pre-filter/lossless coder and a state-of-the-art perceptual audio coder (PAC) shows that the new method achieves a comparable compression ratio and audio quality with a lower delay ", "keyword": "perceptual audio coding; adaptive pre-filters; adaptive post-filters; lossless;compression; high compression ratio; low encoding/decoding delay;;source signals; music; sampling rates; redundancy reduction; adaptive;filtering; predictive coding; psycho-acoustically controlled adaptive;linear filter; irrelevance reduction; predictive lossless coding;;weighted cascaded least mean squared; WCLMS lossless coder; subjective;listening test; pre-filter/lossless coder; audio quality;", "title": "Perceptual audio coding using adaptive pre- and post-filters and lossless \tcompression"}

The subjects consisted of 12 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma and 9 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who were treated with radical radiotherapy between July 1999 and February 2001. Image fusion between /sup 18/FDG-PET and MRI/CT was performed using an automatic multimodality image registration algorithm, which used the brain as an internal reference for registration. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was determined based on clinical examination and /sup 18/FDG uptake on the fusion images. Clinical target volume (CTV) was determined following the usual pattern of lymph node spread for each disease entity along with the clinical presentation of each patient. Except for 3 cases with superficial tumors, all the other primary tumors were detected by /sup 18/FDG-PET. The GTV volumes for primary tumors were not changed by image fusion in 19 cases (89%), increased by 49% in one NPC, and decreased by 45% in another NPC. Normal tissue sparing was more easily performed based on clearer GTV and CTV determination on the fusion images. In particular, parotid sparing became possible in 15 patients (71%) whose upper neck areas near the parotid glands were tumor-free by /sup 18/FDG-PET. Within a mean follow-up period of 18 months, no recurrence occurred in the areas defined as CTV, which was treated prophylactically, except for 1 patient who experienced nodal recurrence in the CTV and simultaneous primary site recurrence.

Since this structure is intractable (Brockett and Levine, Statistics & Probability & their Applications, CBS College Publishing, 1984), estimation of house net hold obtained through an appropriately designed simulator using a random number generator with desirable properties is described. Since the model and simulation naturally derives hold given payscale, but JNG and QOGR require payscale given hold, an inverse problem was required to be solved. This required development of a special algorithm, which may be described as a stochastic binary search. Experimental results are presented, in which the simulator is used to determine jackpot pay-scales so as to satisfy legal requirements of approximately 75% of net revenue returned to the players, i.e., 25% net hold for the house (JNG). Details of the algorithm used to solve this problem are presented, and notwithstanding the stochastic nature of the simulation, convergence to a specified hold for the inverse problem has been achieved to within 0.1% in all cases of interest to date ", "keyword": "stochastic recurrences; Jackpot Keno; mathematical model; simulation; Jupiters;Network Gaming; house net hold; piecewise linear; ternary domain split;;random number generator; inverse problem; stochastic binary search;;probability; experimental results; legal requirement; Chinese lottery;game;", "title": "Stochastic recurrences of Jackpot Keno"}
{"abstract": "This paper describes a generalised hybrid ML-EM algorithm for the calculation of maximum likelihood estimates in semiparametric shared frailty models, the Cox proportional hazard models with hazard functions multiplied by a (parametric) frailty random variable. This hybrid method is much faster than the standard EM method and faster than the standard direct maximum likelihood method (ML, Newton-Raphson) for large samples. We have previously applied this method to semiparametric shared gamma frailty models, and verified by simulations the asymptotic and small sample statistical properties of the frailty variance estimates. Let theta /sub 0/ be the true value of the frailty variance parameter. Then the asymptotic distribution is normal for theta /sub 0/>0 while it is a 50-50 mixture between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis for theta /sub 0/=0. For small samples, simulations suggest that the frailty variance estimates are approximately distributed as an x-(100-x)% mixture, 0<or=x<or=50, between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis even for theta /sub 0/>0. We apply this method and verify by simulations these statistical results for semiparametric shared log-normal frailty models.

{"abstract": "Convolutive blind source separation and adaptive beamforming have a similar goal-extracting a source of interest (or multiple sources) while reducing undesired interferences. A benefit of source separation is that it overcomes the conventional cross-talk or leakage problem of adaptive beamforming. Beamforming on the other hand exploits geometric information which is often readily available but not utilized in blind algorithms. We propose to join these benefits by combining cross-power minimization of second-order source separation with geometric linear constraints used in adaptive beamforming. We find that the geometric constraints resolve some of the ambiguities inherent in the independence criterion such as frequency permutations and degrees of freedom provided by additional sensors.

We extend this test to the more general situation where the zero probability is allowed to depend on covariates. The performance of this test is evaluated using a simulation study. To identify potentially important covariates in the zero-inflation model a composite test is proposed.

FLID-DL congestion control coexists with transmission control protocol (TCP) flows as well as other FLID-DL sessions and supports general rates on the different multicast layers. We demonstrate via simulations that our congestion control scheme exhibits better fairness properties and provides better throughput than previous methods. A key contribution that enables FLID-DL and may be useful elsewhere is dynamic layering (DL), which mitigates the negative impact of long IGMP leave latencies and eliminates the need for probe intervals present in RLC.

These bounds hold even when group dynamics are not known a priori. Our rekeying algorithm requires a particular clustering of the members of the secure multicast group. We describe a protocol to achieve such clustering and show that it is feasible to efficiently cluster members over realistic Internet-like topologies. We evaluate the overhead of our own rekeying scheme and also of previously published schemes via simulation over an Internet topology map containing over 280 000 routers.

After presenting an analytic model for the system based on a hierarchical key tree, we show that there is an optimal number of servers to achieve minimum system bandwidth. As the underlying user traffic fluctuates, we propose a simple dynamic scheme with low overhead where a physical server adaptively splits and merges its traffic into multiple groups each served by a logical server so as to minimize its total bandwidth.

This time resolution reduces the need for exact contrast timing while also providing dynamic information. Spatial resolution is determined primarily by the projection readout resolution and is thus isotropic across the FOV, which is also isotropic. Although undersampling the outer regions of k-space introduces aliased energy into the image, which may compromise resolution, this is not a limiting factor in high-contrast applications such as MRA.

Specifically, we evaluate the metamodel relating to stereotypes versus subtypes; the various kinds of Classifier (particularly Types, Interfaces and Classes); the introduction of a new subtype for the whole part relationship; as well as identifying areas in the metamodel where the UML seems to have been used inappropriately in the very definition of the UML's metamodel ", "keyword": "subtypes; stereotypes; UML model; Unified Modeling Language; Object Management;Group; Request For Information; Classifier; whole part relationship;", "title": "The use of subtypes and stereotypes in the UML model"}
{"abstract": "A new algorithm, devoted to molecular descriptor selection in the context of data mining problems, has been developed. This algorithm is based on the concepts of genetic algorithms (GA) for descriptor hyperspace exploration and combined with a stepwise approach to get local convergence. Its selection power was evaluated by a fitness function derived from a fuzzy clustering method. Different training and test sets were randomly generated at each GA generation. The fitness score was derived by combining the scores of the training and test sets. The ability of the proposed algorithm to select relevant subsets of descriptors was tested on two data sets. The first one, an academic example, corresponded to the artificial problem of Bullseye, the second was a real data set including 114 olfactory compounds divided into three odor categories. In both cases, the proposed method allowed to improve the separation between the different data set classes ", "keyword": "molecular descriptor selection; database mining; data mining; genetic;algorithms; fuzzy clustering method; fuzzy logic; descriptor hyperspace;exploration; local convergence; stepwise approach; fitness function;;test sets; training sets; fitness score; Bullseye; olfactory compounds;;odor categories;", "title": "Molecular descriptor selection combining genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic: \tapplication to database mining procedures"}
{"abstract": "Application-layer multicast supports group applications without the need for a network-layer multicast protocol. Here, applications arrange themselves in a logical overlay network and transfer data within the overlay. We present an application-layer multicast solution that uses a Delaunay triangulation as an overlay network topology. An advantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that it allows each application to locally derive next-hop routing information without requiring a routing protocol in the overlay. A disadvantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal. We present a protocol, called Delaunay triangulation (DT protocol), which constructs Delaunay triangulation overlay networks. We present measurement experiments of the DT protocol for overlay networks with up to 10 000 members, that are running on a local PC cluster with 100 Linux PCs. The results show that the protocol stabilizes quickly, e.g., an overlay network with 10 000 nodes can be built in just over 30 s. The traffic measurements indicate that the average overhead of a node is only a few kilobits per second if the overlay network is in a steady state. Results of throughput experiments of multicast transmissions (using TCP unicast connections between neighbors in the overlay network) show an achievable throughput of approximately 15 Mb/s in an overlay with 100 nodes and 2 Mb/s in an overlay with 1000 nodes ", "keyword": "application-layer multicasting; Delaunay triangulation overlays; group;applications; network-layer multicast protocol; logical overlay;network; data transfer; Delaunay triangulation protocol; measurement;experiments; overlay networks; local PC cluster; Linux PC; overlay;network topology; next-hop routing information; data link layer; DT;protocol; network nodes; traffic measurements; average overhead;;throughput experiments; multicast transmissions; TCP unicast;connections; 15 Mbit/s; 2 Mbit/s;", "title": "Application-layer multicasting with Delaunay triangulation overlays"}
{"abstract": "The conventional wisdom has been that Internet protocol (IP) is the natural protocol layer for implementing multicast related functionality. However, more than a decade after its initial proposal, IP multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability, network management, deployment, and support for higher layer functionality such as error, flow, and congestion control. We explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast, where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP multicast. However, the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model. In particular, end system multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end-to-end delays than IP multicast. We study these performance concerns in the context of the Narada protocol. In Narada, end systems self-organize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol. Further, end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance. We present details of Narada and evaluate it using both simulation and Internet experiments. Our results indicate that the performance penalties are low both from the application and the network perspectives. We believe the potential benefits of transferring multicast functionality from end systems to routers significantly outweigh the performance penalty incurred ", "keyword": "end system multicast; Internet protocol; protocol layer; IP multicast; network;management; network scalability; higher layer functionality; congestion;control; membership management; packet replication; network routers;;end-to-end delays; Narada protocol; overlay structure; distributed;protocol; network dynamics; application level performance; simulation;;Internet experiments; performance penalties; self-organizing protocol;", "title": "A case for end system multicast"}

{"abstract": "The purpose of this article is to raise and address a number of issues pertaining to the conversion of Common Communication Format (CCF) into MARC21. In this era of global resource sharing, exchange of bibliographic records from one system to another is imperative in today's library communities. Instead of using a single standard to create machine-readable catalogue records, more than 20 standards have emerged and are being used by different institutions. Because of these variations in standards, sharing of resources and transfer of data from one system to another among the institutions locally and globally has become a significant problem. Addressing this problem requires keeping in mind that countries such as India and others in southeast Asia are using the CCF as a standard for creating bibliographic cataloguing records. This paper describes a way to map the bibliographic catalogue records from CCF to MARC21, although 100% mapping is not possible. In addition, the paper describes an experimental approach that enumerates problems that may occur during the mapping of records/exchanging of records and how these problems can be overcome ", "keyword": "Common Communication Format conversion; MARC21; global resource sharing;;bibliographic records exchange; library communities; machine-readable;catalogue records; standards; data transfer; India; southeast Asia; CCF;to MARC21 mapping;", "title": "Mapping CCF to MARC21: an experimental approach"}

In this work, we address these difficulties and propose a two phase regression testing methodology. In phase 1, we explore control flow and data flow analysis issues of database applications. Then, we propose an impact analysis technique that is based on dependencies that exist among the components of database applications. This analysis leads to selecting test cases from the initial test suite for regression testing the modified application. In phase 2, further reduction in the regression test cases is performed by using reduction algorithms. We present two such algorithms. The Graph Walk algorithm walks through the control flow graph of database modules and selects a safe set of test cases to retest. The Call Graph Firewall algorithm uses a firewall for the inter procedural level. Finally, a maintenance environment for database applications is described.

A distinctive feature of the proposed technique is a procedure by which, given a \"good\" starting filter, \"good\" filters of longer lengths are generated.

Concerning the aperiodic exchanges, the situation is different since their priority is lower and they are bandied according to a first-come-first-served policy. In this paper, a response-time-based schedulability analysis for the real-time traffic is presented. Such analysis considers both types of traffic in an integrated way, according to their priorities. Furthermore, a fixed-priorities-based policy is also used to schedule the periodic traffic. The proposed analysis represents an improvement relative to previous work and it can be evaluated online as part of a traffic online admission control. This feature is of particular importance when a planning scheduler is used, instead of the typical offline static scheduler, to allow online changes to the set of periodic process variables ", "keyword": "WorldFIP Networks; EN-50170 European fieldbus standard; real-time traffic;schedulability analysis; distributed computer-controlled systems;;communication services; aperiodic exchanges; traffic online admission;control; first-come-first-served policy; periodic process variables;;real-time communication; scheduling algorithms; response time;", "title": "Schedulability analysis of real-time traffic in WorldFIP networks: an \tintegrated approach"}

The line conditioner is made up of an AC chopper with reversible voltage control and a transformer for series voltage compensation. In the AC chopper, a proper switching operation is achieved without the commutation problem. To absorb energy stored in line stray inductance, a regenerative DC snubber can be utilized which has only one capacitor without discharging resistors or complicated regenerative circuit for snubber energy. Therefore, the proposed AC chopper gives high efficiency and reliability. The output voltage of the line conditioner is controlled using a fast sensing technique of the output voltage. It is also shown via some experimental results that the presented line conditioner gives good dynamic and steady-state performance for high quality of the output voltage ", "keyword": "pulsewidth-modulated line conditioner; output voltage control; AC chopper;;reversible voltage control; series voltage compensation transformer;;switching operation; commutation; line stray inductance; regenerative;DC snubber; dynamic performance; steady-state performance;", "title": "Novel line conditioner with voltage up/down capability"}

The study addresses device count, DC filter ratings, restrictions on voltage control, active power transfer through the DC link, and balancing of DC-link voltages. Emphasis is placed on capacitor sizing because of its impact on the cost and size of the FACTS controller. A method for the dimensioning the DC capacitor filter is presented. It is found that the chain converter is attractive for the implementation of a static compensator or a static synchronous series compensator.

{"abstract": "We suggest a pivot rule for the primal simplex algorithm for the minimum cost flow problem, known as the network simplex algorithm. Due to degeneracy, cycling may occur in the network simplex algorithm. The cycling can be prevented by maintaining strongly feasible bases proposed by Cunningham (1976); however, if we do not impose any restrictions on the entering variables, the algorithm can still perform an exponentially long sequence of degenerate pivots. This phenomenon is known as stalling. Researchers have suggested several pivot rules with the following bounds on the number of consecutive degenerate pivots: m, n/sup 2/, k(k + 1)/2, where n is the number of nodes in the network, m is the number of arcs in the network, and k is the number of degenerate arcs in the basis.

{"abstract": "Network caching of objects has become a standard way of reducing network traffic and latency in the Web. However, Web caches exhibit poor performance with a hit rate of about 30%. A solution to improve this hit rate is to have a group of proxies form co-operation where objects can be cached for later retrieval. A cooperative cache system includes protocols for hierarchical and transversal caching. The drawback of such a system lies in the resulting network load due to the number of messages that need to be exchanged to locate an object. This paper proposes a new co-operative Web caching architecture, which unifies previous methods of Web caching.

We use findings from information systems research to structure a meta-analysis of uptake issues as reported in CSCW case studies, supplemented by a detailed re-examination of one of our own case studies from this perspective. This shows that while there are some factors which seem to be largely specific to CSCW introductions, many of the case study results are very similar to standard IS findings.

The quantitative comparison of brain architecture across different subjects requires a common coordinate system. For the analysis of a specific brain area, it is necessary to normalize and compare a region of interest and the global brain.

The method in this paper uses feature similarities of local regions as well as intensity similarities. The lateral ventricle and central gray nuclei of the brain, including the corpus callosum, which is used for features in schizophrenia detection, is appropriately normalized.

The caller may interact with the system to request a phone number by providing just a work area, specialty, surname, or title, etc. If the party is absent, the system may provide extra information such as where he went, when he will be back, and what he is doing. The system is built modularly, with components such as speech recognizer, language model, dialog manager and text-to-speech that can be replaced if necessary. By simply changing the personnel record database, the system can easily be ported to other companies. The sophisticated dialog manager applies many strategies to allow natural interaction between user and system.

{"abstract": "We present a fully automated cerebrum segmentation algorithm for full three-dimensional sagittal brain MR images. First, cerebrum segmentation from a midsagittal brain MR image is performed utilizing landmarks, anatomical information, and a connectivity-based threshold segmentation algorithm as previously reported. Recognizing that the cerebrum in laterally adjacent slices tends to have similar size and shape, we use the cerebrum segmentation result from the midsagittal brain MR image as a mask to guide cerebrum segmentation in adjacent lateral slices in an iterative fashion. This masking operation yields a masked image (preliminary cerebrum segmentation) for the next lateral slice, which may truncate brain region(s). Truncated regions are restored by first finding end points of their boundaries, by comparing the mask image and masked image boundaries, and then applying a connectivity-based algorithm. The resulting final extracted cerebrum image for this slice is then used as a mask for the next lateral slice. The algorithm yielded satisfactory fully automated cerebrum segmentations in three-dimensional sagittal brain MR images, and had performance superior to conventional edge detection algorithms for segmentation of cerebrum from 3D sagittal brain MR images ", "keyword": "fully automated cerebrum segmentation algorithm; full 3D sagittal brain MR;images; midsagittal brain MR image; landmarks; anatomical information;;connectivity-based threshold segmentation algorithm; laterally adjacent;slices; masking operation; brain region truncation; boundary end;points; masked image boundaries; connectivity-based algorithm;", "title": "Automated cerebrum segmentation from three-dimensional sagittal brain MR images"}

The platform transforms any echograph into a test-system for evaluating the diagnostic effectiveness of new investigation techniques. A particular user interface was designed in order to allow a real-time and simultaneous visualization of the results produced in the different stages of the chosen processing procedure. This is aimed at obtaining a better optimization of the processing algorithm. The most important platform aspect, which also constitutes the basic differentiation with respect to similar systems, is the direct processing of the radiofrequency echo signal, which is essential for a complete analysis of the particular ultrasound-media interaction phenomenon. The platform completely integrates the architecture of a personal computer (PC) giving rise to several benefits, such as the quick technological evolution in the PC field and an extreme degree of programmability for different applications.

{"abstract": "This paper describes a new technique for two-dimensional (2-D) imaging of the motion vector at a very high frame rate with ultrasound. Its potential is experimentally demonstrated for transient elastography. But, beyond this application, it also could be promising for color flow and reflectivity imaging. To date, only axial displacements induced in human tissues by low-frequency vibrators were measured during transient elastography. The proposed technique allows us to follow both axial and lateral displacements during the shear wave propagation and thus should improve Young's modulus image reconstruction. The process is a combination of several ideas well-known in ultrasonic imaging: ultra-fast imaging, multisynthetic aperture beamforming, 1-D speckle tracking, and compound imaging. Classical beamforming in the transmit mode is replaced here by a single plane wave insonification increasing the frame rate by at least a factor of 128. The beamforming is achieved only in the receive mode on two independent subapertures. Comparison of successive frames by a classical 1-D speckle tracking algorithm allows estimation of displacements along two different directions linked to the subapertures beams. The variance of the estimates is finally improved by tilting the emitting plane wave at each insonification, thus allowing reception of successive decorrelated speckle patterns ", "keyword": "ultrafast compound imaging; 2D motion vector estimation; two-dimensional;imaging; transient elastography; 2D imaging; high frame rate;;ultrasound; colour flow imaging; reflectivity imaging; human tissues;;axial displacements; lateral displacements; shear wave propagation;;Young's modulus image reconstruction; ultrasonic imaging;;multisynthetic aperture beamforming; 1D speckle tracking algorithm;;decorrelated speckle patterns; single plane wave insonification;", "title": "Ultrafast compound imaging for 2-D motion vector estimation: application to \ttransient elastography"}
{"abstract": "Interconnected ultrathin conducting wires or, equivalently, interconnected quasi-one-dimensional electron waveguides, which form a quantum resistor network, are presented here in four-terminal configurations. The transmission behaviors through such four-terminal networks are evaluated and classified. In addition, we show that such networks can be used as the basic building blocks for a possible massive wave computing machine in the future. In a network, each interconnection, a node point, is an elastic scatterer that routes the electron wave. Routing and rerouting of electron waves in a network is described in the framework of quantum transport from Landauer-Buttiker theory in the presence of multiple elastic scatterers. Transmissions through various types of four-terminal generalized clean Aharonov-Bohm rings are investigated at zero temperature. Useful logic functions are gathered based on the transmission probability to each terminal with the use of the Buttiker symmetry rule. In the generalized rings, even and odd numbers of terminals can possess some distinctly different transmission characteristics as we have shown here and earlier. Just as an even or odd number of atoms in a ring is an important quantity for classifying the transmission behavior, we show here that whether the number of terminals is an even or an odd number is just as important in understanding the physics of transmission through such a ring. Furthermore, we show that there are three basic classes of four-terminal rings and the scaling relation for each class is provided. In particular, the existence of equitransmission among all four terminals is shown here. This particular physical phenomena cannot exist in any three-terminal ring. Comparisons and discussions of transmission characteristics between three-terminal and four-terminal rings are also presented. The node-equation approach by considering the Kirchhoff current conservation law at each node point is used for this analysis. Many useful logic functions for electron-wave computing are shown here. In particular, we show that a full adder can be constructed very simply using the equitransmission property of the four-terminal ring.

{"abstract": "We introduce the permission grid, a spatial occupancy grid which can be used to guide almost any standard polygonal surface simplification algorithm into generating an approximation with a guaranteed geometric error bound. In particular, all points on the approximation are guaranteed to be within some user-specified distance from the original surface. Such bounds are notably absent from many current simplification methods, and are becoming increasingly important for applications in scientific computing and adaptive level of detail control. Conceptually simple, the permission grid defines a volume in which the approximation must lie, and does not permit the underlying simplification algorithm to generate approximations outside the volume. The permission grid makes three important, practical improvements over current error-bounded simplification methods. First, it works on arbitrary triangular models, handling all manners of mesh degeneracies gracefully. Further, the error tolerance may be easily expanded as simplification proceeds, allowing the construction of an error-bounded level of detail hierarchy with vertex correspondences among all levels of detail. And finally, the permission grid has a representation complexity independent of the size of the input model, and a small running time overhead, making it more practical and efficient than current methods with similar guarantees ", "keyword": "permission grid; spatial occupancy grid; polygonal surface simplification;algorithm; guaranteed geometric error bound; approximation;;error-bounded simplification; user-specified distance; scientific;computing; adaptive level of detail control; arbitrary triangular;models; mesh degeneracies; error tolerance; vertex correspondences;;representation complexity; running time overhead;", "title": "Permission grids: practical, error-bounded simplification"}

{"abstract": "Color management for the printing of digital images is a challenging task, due primarily to nonlinear ink-mixing behavior and the presence of redundant solutions for print devices with more than three inks. Algorithms for the conversion of image data to printer-specific format are typically designed to achieve a single predetermined rendering intent, such as colorimetric accuracy. We present two CIELAB to CMYK color conversion schemes based on a general Pareto-optimal formulation for printer color management. The schemes operate using a 149-color characterization data set selected to efficiently capture the entire CMYK gamut. The first scheme uses artificial neural networks as transfer functions between the CIELAB and CMYK spaces. The second scheme is based on a reformulation of tetrahedral interpolation as an optimization problem.

{"abstract": "We describe an implementation of procedural solid texturing that uses the texture atlas, a one-to-one mapping from an object's surface into its texture space. The method uses the graphics hardware to rasterize the solid texture coordinates as colors directly into the atlas. A texturing procedure is applied per-pixel to the texture map, replacing each solid texture coordinate with its corresponding procedural solid texture result. The procedural solid texture is then mapped back onto the object surface using standard texture mapping. The implementation renders procedural solid textures in real time, and the user can design them interactively. The quality of this technique depends greatly on the layout of the texture atlas. A broad survey of texture atlas schemes is used to develop a set of general purpose mesh atlases and tools for measuring their effectiveness at distributing as many available texture samples as evenly across the surface as possible. The main contribution of this paper is a new multiresolution texture atlas. It distributes all available texture samples in a nearly uniform distribution. This multiresolution texture atlas also supports MIP-mapped minification antialiasing and linear magnification filtering ", "keyword": "real-time procedural solid texturing; meshed atlases; texture atlas; one-to-one;mapping; object surface; texture space; graphics hardware;;rasterization; solid texture coordinates; colors; rendering;;multiresolution texture atlas; linear magnification filtering;;MIP-mapped minification antialiasing;", "title": "Meshed atlases for real-time procedural solid texturing"}
{"abstract": "This paper presents a new approach for generating coarse-level approximations of topologically complex models. Dramatic topology reduction is achieved by converting a 3D model to and from a volumetric representation. Our approach produces valid, error-bounded models and supports the creation of approximations that do not interpenetrate the original model, either being completely contained in the input solid or bounding it. Several simple to implement versions of our approach are presented and discussed.

{"abstract": "The people who use computers and the ways they use them have changed substantially over the past 25 years. In the beginning highly educated people, mostly men, in technical professions used computers for work, but over time a much broader range of people are using computers for personal and domestic purposes. This trend is still continuing, and over a shorter time scale has been replicated with the use of the Internet. The paper uses data from four national surveys to document how personal computers and the Internet have become increasingly domesticated since 1995 and to explore the mechanisms for this shift. Now people log on more often from home than from places of employment and do so for pleasure and for personal purposes rather than for their jobs. Analyses comparing veteran Internet users to novices in 1998 and 2000 and analyses comparing the change in use within a single sample between 1995 and 1996 support two complementary explanations for how these technologies have become domesticated. Women, children, and less well-educated individuals are increasingly using computers and the Internet and have a more personal set of motives than well-educated men. In addition, the widespread diffusion of the PC and the Internet and the response of the computing industry to the diversity in consumers has led to a rich set of personal and domestic services ", "keyword": "computer domestication; Internet; highly educated people; technical;professions; domestic purposes; personal usage; national surveys;;personal computers; veteran Internet users; novices; women; children;;personal motives; PC diffusion; computing industry; domestic services;;demographics; online behavior;", "title": "Domesticating computers and the Internet"}
{"abstract": "This study investigated the application of genetic algorithms in solving a fuzzy optimization problem that arises in business and economics. In this problem, a fuzzy price is determined using a linear or a quadratic fuzzy demand function as well as a linear cost function. The objective is to find the optimal fuzzy profit, which is derived from the fuzzy price and fuzzy cost. Traditional methods for solving this problem are (1) the extension principle, and (2) using interval arithmetic and alpha -cuts. However, we argue that traditional methods for solving this problem are too restrictive to produce an optimal solution, and that an alternative approach is possibly needed. We use genetic algorithms to obtain an approximate solution for this fuzzy optimal profit problem without using membership functions. We not only give empirical examples to show the effectiveness of this approach, but also give theoretical proofs to validate correctness of the algorithm. We conclude that genetic algorithms can produce good approximate solutions when applied to solve fuzzy optimization problems ", "keyword": "genetic algorithms; fuzzy optimization problem; fuzzy optimal profit problem;;economics; business; fuzzy price; quadratic fuzzy demand function;;linear fuzzy demand function; linear cost function; approximate;solution; theoretical proofs; algorithm correctness validation;", "title": "Applying genetic algorithms to solve the fuzzy optimal profit problem"}
{"abstract": "Between 1997 and 2001, two mid-sized communities in Canada hosted North America's most comprehensive experiment to introduce electronic cash and, in the process, replace physical cash for casual, low-value payments. The technology used was Mondex, and its implementation was supported by all the country's major banks. It was launched with an extensive publicity campaign to promote Mondex not only in the domestic but also in the global market, for which the Canadian implementation was to serve as a \"showcase.\" However, soon after the start of the first field test it became apparent that the new technology did not work smoothly. On the contrary, it created a host of controversies, in areas as varied as computer security, consumer privacy, and monetary policy. In the following years, few of these controversies could be resolved and Mondex could not be established as a widely used payment mechanism. In 2001, the experiment was finally terminated. Using the concepts developed in recent science and technology studies (STS), the article analyzes these controversies as resulting from the difficulties of fitting electronic cash, a new sociotechnical system, into the complex setting of the existing payment system. The story of Mondex not only offers lessons on why technologies fail, but also offers insight into how short-term failures can contribute to long-term transformations. This suggests the need to rethink the dichotomy of success and failure ", "keyword": "electronic cash; Canada; low-value payments; Mondex; major banks; publicity;campaign; global market; Canadian implementation; computer security;;consumer privacy; monetary policy; payment mechanism; science and;technology studies; sociotechnical system; short-term failures;;long-term transformations;", "title": "Failures and successes: notes on the development of electronic cash"}

As such it is a fundamental human value mobilizing diverse ideologies and sensitivities. The promise of realizing this value in a new domain naturally stirs up much excitement among optimistic observers of the Internet. At the same time, the eagerness to place hopes for community in a technical system flies in the face of an influential intellectual tradition of technology criticism. This eagerness seems even more naive in the light of the recent commercialization of so much Internet activity. Despite the widespread skepticism, we believe the growth of virtual community is significant for an inquiry into the democratization of technology. We show that conflicting answers to the central question of the present theoretical debate - Is community possible on computer networks? epsilon neralize from particular features of systems and software prevalent at different stages in the development of computer networking.

{"abstract": "One of the most popular data assimilation techniques in use today are of the Kalman filter type, which provide an improved estimate of the state of a system up to the current time level, based on actual measurements. From a forecasting viewpoint, this corresponds to an updating of the initial conditions. The standard forecasting procedure is to then run the model uncorrected into the future, driven by predicted boundary and forcing conditions. The problem with this methodology is that the updated initial conditions quickly 'wash-out', thus, after a certain forecast horizon the model predictions are no better than from an initially uncorrected model. This study demonstrates that through the assimilation of error forecasts (in the present case made using so-called local models) entire model domains can be corrected for extended forecast horizons (i.e. long after updated initial conditions have become washed-out), thus demonstrating significant improvements over the conventional methodology. Some alternate uses of local models are also explored for the re-distribution of error forecasts over the entire model domain, which are then compared with more conventional Kalman filter type schemes ", "keyword": "data assimilation; local model error forecasts; deterministic model; Kalman;filter; forcing conditions; forecast horizon; error prediction;;hydrodynamic modelling;", "title": "Data assimilation of local model error forecasts in a deterministic model"}

{"abstract": "This paper is concerned with the design and analysis of adaptive wavelet methods for systems of operator equations. Its main accomplishment is to extend the range of applicability of the adaptive wavelet-based method developed previously for symmetric positive definite problems to indefinite or unsymmetric systems of operator equations. This is accomplished by first introducing techniques (such as the least squares formulation developed previously) that transform the original (continuous) problem into an equivalent infinite system of equations which is now well-posed in the Euclidean metric. It is then shown how to utilize adaptive techniques to solve the resulting infinite system of equations. It is shown that for a wide range of problems, this new adaptive method performs with asymptotically optimal complexity, i.e., it recovers an approximate solution with desired accuracy at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of terms in a corresponding wavelet-best N-term approximation. An important advantage of this adaptive approach is that it automatically stabilizes the numerical procedure so that, for instance, compatibility constraints on the choice of trial spaces, like the LBB condition, no longer arise ", "keyword": "adaptive wavelet methods; elliptic case; operator equations; least squares;formulation; Euclidean metric; asymptotically optimal complexity;;N-term approximation;", "title": "Adaptive wavelet methods.

For two given strings of length m and n, where m>or=n, the algorithm can solve the LCS problem in m+2r-1 (respectively n+2r-1) time steps with r<n/2 (respectively r<m/2) processors. Experimental results show that the algorithm can be faster on multicomputers than all the previous systolic algorithms for the same problem ", "keyword": "systolic algorithm; longest common subsequence problem; scalable algorithm;;parallel algorithms;", "title": "A scalable and efficient systolic algorithm for the longest common subsequence \tproblem"}

{"abstract": "We introduce new families of Gaussian-type quadratures for weighted integrals of exponential functions and consider their applications to integration and interpolation of bandlimited functions. We use a generalization of a representation theorem due to Caratheodory to derive these quadratures. For each positive measure, the quadratures are parameterized by eigenvalues of the Toeplitz matrix constructed from the trigonometric moments of the measure. For a given accuracy epsilon , selecting an eigenvalue close to epsilon yields an approximate quadrature with that accuracy. To compute its weights and nodes, we present a new fast algorithm. These new quadratures can be used to approximate and integrate bandlimited functions, such as prolate spheroidal wave functions, and essentially bandlimited functions, such as Bessel functions. We also develop, for a given precision, an interpolating basis for bandlimited functions on an interval ", "keyword": "generalized Gaussian quadratures; weighted integrals; exponential functions;;integration; interpolation; bandlimited functions; Caratheodory;representation theorem; eigenvalues; Toeplitz matrix; trigonometric;moments; approximation; prolate spheroidal wave functions; Bessel;functions;", "title": "On generalized Gaussian quadratures for exponentials and their applications"}

First, we show that this framework permits us to redefine existing deblurring methods.

This new technique benefits from both classical approaches: a priori pruning of the search space from filtering-based search and possible repair of early mistakes from local search.

{"abstract": "Much has been written about the leaky pipeline of women in computer science (CS), with the percentage of women decreasing as one moves from lower levels, such as college, to higher levels, culminating in full professorship. While significant attention focused on keeping women from leaving the pipeline, there is also an opportunity to bring women into the pipeline through non-traditional programs, instead of requiring that everyone enter at the undergraduate level. Both Mills College, a small liberal arts institution for women, and UC Berkeley, a large research university, established programs in the 80's to increase the number of women in computer science by tapping non-traditional students. Both programs share the core value of accommodating older students lacking technical backgrounds. The two programs have produced similar results: graduate degrees earned in computer science by students who would not have qualified without these programs, professional employment in the computer science field by women and minorities, and a recognition that this population represents a rich source of talent for our nation ", "keyword": "reentry programs; computer science; women; Mills College; UC Berkeley; graduate;degrees; students; professional employment; minorities;", "title": "Leveraging an alternative source of computer scientists: reentry programs"}

{"abstract": "An automatic laser-based system to measure the internal profiles of various structures has been developed. The system uses a point laser source through a rotating optical device fixed on to a laser measurement meter. A notebook computer with custom software is used to control the laser meter and rotating device to estimate the scanned profile shape and to determine the resulting cross-section area. The information provided by this system is essential to construction industry, including window and door builders; the glass, panel, board, and floor tile manufacturers; carpet venders; and building contractors for cost estimation and production control. As a result, the lead time for delivering the customized windowpanes, woodwork, floor tiles, and ceilings can be reduced. Applications of this system for measuring the shapes of window frames and floor plans are described and demonstrated. The measurement accuracy is evaluated and analyzed. Results have indicated that the measurement accuracy can be achieved within 4% of the measurement distance, for typical window designs and floor patterns required by major window manufacturers. Recommendations to improve the system are also included ", "keyword": "laser-based internal profile measurement system; internal profiles; point laser;source; rotating optical device; laser meter; rotating device; floor;tile manufacturers; carpet venders; building contractors; cost;estimation; production control; customized windowpanes; window frames;", "title": "Laser-based internal profile measurement system"}

{"abstract": "The internal rate of return (IRR) criterion is often used to evaluate profitability of investment projects. In this paper, we focus on a single-period project which consists of two types of cash flows; an investment at one period and a return at a succeeding period, and a financing at one period and a repayment at a succeeding period. We decompose the given investment project into a series of the single-period projects. From the viewpoint of the single-period project, we point out the applicability issue of the IRR criterion, namely the IRR criterion cannot be applied in which a project is composed of both investment type and financing type. Investigating the properties of a series of the single-period projects, we resolve the applicability issue of the IRR criterion and propose the decision procedure for profitability judgment toward any type of investment project based on the comparison between the IRR and the capital cost. We develop a new algorithm to obtain the value of the project investment rate (PIR) for the given project, which is a function of the capital cost, only using the standard IRR computing routine. This outcome is a theoretical breakthrough to widen the utilization of IRR in practical applications ", "keyword": "decision procedure; investment project profitability; internal rate of return;;single-period projects; profitability; cash flows; investment project;decomposition; IRR criterion; project investment rate; PIR;", "title": "The decision procedure for profitability of investment projects using the \tinternal rate of return of single-period projects"}
{"abstract": "Minoux (1976) considered the maximum balanced flow problem, i.e. the problem of finding a maximum flow in a two-terminal network N = (V,A) with source s and sink t satisfying the constraint that any arc-flow of N is bounded by a fixed proportion of the total flow value from s to t, where V is vertex set and A is arc set. As a generalization, we focus on the problem of maximizing the total flow value of a generalized flow in N with gains gamma (a) > 0 (a in A) where any arc-flow is bounded by a fixed proportion of the total flow value, where gamma (a)f(a) units arrive at the vertex w for each arc-flow f(a) (a identical to ( upsilon , w) in A) entering vertex upsilon in a generalized flow. Our main results are to propose two polynomial algorithms for this problem. The first algorithm runs in O(mM(n, m, B') log B) time, where B is the maximum absolute value among integral values used by an instance of the problem, and M(n, m, B') denotes the complexity of solving a generalized maximum flow problem in a network with n vertices, and m arcs, and a rational instance expressed with integers between 1 and B'.

{"abstract": "This paper describes a heuristic algorithm for the 2D free-form bin packing (2D-FBP) problem. Given a set of 2D free-form bins and a set of 2D free-form items, the 2D-FBP problem is to lay out items inside one or more bins in such a way that the number of bins used is minimized, and for each bin, the yield is maximized. The proposed algorithm handles the problem as a variant of the 1D problem; i.e., items and bins are approximated as sets of scanlines, and scanlines are packed. The details of the algorithm are given, and its application to a nesting problem in a shipbuilding company is reported. The proposed algorithm consists of the basic and the group placement algorithms. The basic placement algorithm is a variant of the first-fit decreasing algorithm which is simply extended from the 1D case to the 2D case by a novel scanline approximation. A numerical study with real instances shows that the basic placement algorithm has sufficient performance for most of the instances, however, the group placement algorithm is required when items must be aligned in columns. The qualities of the resulting layouts are good enough for practical use, and the processing times are good ", "keyword": "scanline-based algorithm; 2D free-form bin packing problem; heuristic;algorithm; 2D-FBP problem; irregular cutting; irregular packing;;nesting problem; minimization; yield maximization; shipbuilding;company; group placement algorithm; first-fit decreasing algorithm;", "title": "A scanline-based algorithm for the 2D free-form bin packing problem"}
{"abstract": "We have developed a simple approach to valuing risky corporate debt when corporations own securities issued by other corporations. We assume that corporate debt can be valued as an option on corporate business asset value, and derive payoff functions when there exist cross-holdings of stock or debt between two firms. Next we show that payoff functions with multiple cross-holdings can be solved by the contraction principle. The payoff functions which we derive provide a number of insights about the risk structure of company cross-holdings. First, the Modigliani-Miller theorem can obtain when there exist cross-holdings between firms. Second, by establishing cross-shareholdings each of stock holders distributes a part of its payoff values to the bond holder of the other's firm, so that both firms can decrease credit risks by cross-shareholdings. In the numerical examples, we show that the correlation in firms can be a critical condition for reducing credit risk by cross-holdings of stock using Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, we show we can calculate the default spread easily when complicated cross-holdings exist, and find which shares are beneficial or disadvantageous ", "keyword": "risky corporate debt valuation; stock holdings; debt holdings; securities;;option; corporate business asset value; payoff functions; multiple;cross-holdings; Modigliani-Miller theorem; cross-shareholdings; bond;holder; credit risks; correlation; Monte Carlo simulation;", "title": "Valuing corporate debt: the effect of cross-holdings of stock and debt"}

{"abstract": "The optimal distribution of steady suction needed to control the growth of single or multiple disturbances in quasi-three-dimensional incompressible boundary layers on a flat plate is investigated. The evolution of disturbances is analysed in the framework of the parabolized stability equations (PSE). A gradient-based optimization procedure is used and the gradients are evaluated using the adjoint of the parabolized stability equations (APSE) and the adjoint of the boundary layer equations (ABLE). The accuracy of the gradient is increased by introducing a stabilization procedure for the PSE. Results show that a suction peak appears in the upstream part of the suction region for optimal control of Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves, steady streamwise streaks in a two-dimensional boundary layer and oblique waves in a quasi-three-dimensional boundary layer subject to an adverse pressure gradient. The mean flow modifications due to suction are shown to have a stabilizing effect similar to that of a favourable pressure gradient. It is also shown that the optimal suction distribution for the disturbance of interest reduces the growth rate of other perturbations. Results for control of a steady cross-flow mode in a three-dimensional boundary layer subject to a favourable pressure gradient show that not even large amounts of suction can completely stabilize the disturbance ", "keyword": "adjoint-based optimization; steady suction; disturbance control; incompressible;flows; quasithree-dimensional incompressible boundary layers; flat;plate; parabolized stability equations; gradient-based optimization;procedure; stabilization procedure; Tollmien-Schlichting waves; steady;streamwise streaks; oblique waves; adverse pressure gradient; mean;flow; steady cross-flow mode; laminar-turbulent transition;", "title": "Adjoint-based optimization of steady suction for disturbance control in \tincompressible flows"}

{"abstract": "The paper provides three different schemes for speaker identification of personnel from their voice using artificial neural networks. The first scheme recognizes speakers by employing the classical backpropagation algorithm pre-trained with known voice samples of the persons. The second scheme provides a framework for classifying the known training samples of the voice features using a hierarchical architecture realized with a self-organizing feature map neural net. The first scheme is highly robust as it is capable of identifying the personnel from their noisy voice samples, but because of its excessive training time it has limited applications for a large voice database. The second scheme though not so robust as the former, however, can classify an unknown voice sample to its nearest class. The time needed for classification by the first scheme is always unique irrespective of the voice sample. It is proportional to the number of feedforward layers in the network. The time-requirement of the second classification scheme, however, is not free from the voice features and is proportional to the number of 2D arrays traversed by the algorithm on the hierarchical structure. The third scheme is highly robust and mis-classification is as low as 0.2 per cent. The third scheme combines the composite benefits of a radial basis function neural net and backpropagation trained neural net ", "keyword": "speaker identification; artificial neural networks; personnel; hierarchical;architecture; self-organizing feature map; backpropagation algorithm;;classification; feedforward layers; 2D arrays; radial basis function;neural net; pre-training; known voice samples;", "title": "Speaker identification from voice using neural networks"}

For example, there are relatively scant numbers of jobs as a computer science professor-at any level. An individual considering an academic job may only be interested in research universities, or in teaching universities, restricting the choice of open positions substantially.

{"abstract": "For nonlinear time-invariant input-output dynamical systems the passivity conditions are obtained under some restrictions. The conditions imply storage functions satisfying a dissipation inequality. A class of storage functions allowing unique reconstruction of a passive dynamical system is defined. These results are illustrated by an example of a linear system with fading memory. An important, for practical application, class of the linear relaxation systems without direct input-output interaction is considered. A necessary condition for dynamical systems to be of the relaxation type is obtained for this class.

{"abstract": "An approach to robust control systems synthesis, both linear and nonlinear, and nonstationary is offered. The control is carried out, providing the given phase constraints varied in acceptable limits, in view of constraints on its value and incompleteness of the information about functioning disturbances. The approach is based on the introduction of auxiliary integral surfaces, on which the initial moving is projected. As a result the reduced equivalent moving is formed, being described by the scalar equation which in many important cases can be integrated directly. On the basis of the equation obtained solving a synthesis task is carried out and can be reduced to algebraic or integral inequalities.

To this aim we propose to eliminate the need to solve optimization problems at successive iterations of interactive decision processes. We show that the need for optimization can be eliminated by the ability of establishing sufficiently tight bounds on criteria values for efficient decisions prior to explicit identification of such decisions. We present a technique, fully operational and numerically simple, for establishing such bounds. Bounds are dynamic, i.e., they become stronger with the growing number of decisions explicitly identified. They are also parametric with respect to weighting coefficients. We also point out how this technique can enhance the existing interactive decision making methods ", "keyword": "multiple criteria decision making; interactive decision making schemes;;decision makers; criteria values bounds; efficient decisions;", "title": "Multiple criteria decision making without optimization"}

Twenty solitary lung nodules smaller than 30 mm in diameter, including 10 lung cancers and 10 benign nodules, were used. The nodules were grouped subjectively according to their subtlety. For nonnodular cases, 20 nodules without perceptible interval changes were selected. All chest radiographs were obtained by using a computed radiographic system, and temporal subtraction images were produced by using a program developed at the University of Chicago. The effect of the temporal subtraction image was evaluated by using an observer performance study, with use of receiver operating characteristic analysis. Observer performance with temporal subtraction images was substantially improved (A/sub z/ = 0.980 and 0.958), as compared with that without temporal subtraction images (A/sub z/ = 0.920 and 0.825) for the certified radiologists and radiology residents, respectively.

These research questions are the subject of the paper. We propose a model that links the e-service company's knowledge-based competencies with their competitive capabilities. Drawing from the current literature, our analysis suggests that services that strategically build a portfolio of knowledge-based competencies, namely human capital, structural capital, and absorptive capacity have more operations-based options, than their counterparts who are less apt to invest. We assume that the combinative capabilities of service quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost are determined by the investment in intellectual capital. Arguably, with the advent of the Internet, different operating models (e.g., bricks-and-mortar, clicks-and-mortar, or pure dot-com) have different strategic imperatives in terms of knowledge-based competencies.

{"abstract": "The building and construction industry is the major industry of Hong Kong as in many developed countries around the world. After the commissioning of a high-rise building or a large estate, substantial manpower, both inside the management centre under a standby manner, as well as surveillance for security purposes around the whole building, is required for daily operation to ensure a quality environment for the occupants. If the surveillance job can be done by robots, the efficiency can be highly enhanced, resulting in a great saving of manpower and the improved safety of the management staff as a by-product. Furthermore, if the robot can retrieve commands from the building management system via a local area network (LAN), further savings in manpower can be achieved in terms of first-line fault attendance by human management staff. This paper describes the development of a robot prototype here in Hong Kong, which can handle some daily routine maintenance works and surveillance responsibilities. The hardware structure of the robot and its on-board devices are described. Real-time images captured by a camera on the robot with pan/tilt/zoom functions can be transmitted back to the central management office via a local area network. The interface between the robot and the building automation system (BAS) of the building is discussed. This is the first key achievement of this project with a strong implication on reducing the number of human staff to manage a modem building. Teleoperation of the robot via the Internet or intranet is also possible, which is the second achievement of this project. Finally, the robot can identify its physical position inside the building by a landmark recognition method based on standard CAD drawings, which is the third achievement of this project.

In addition, the more the size of robotic excavators increases, the more the length and mass of the excavator links; the more the parameters of a heavy-duty excavator vary. A time-delay control with switching action (TDCSA) using an integral sliding surface is proposed in this paper for the control of a 21-ton robotic excavator. Through analysis and experiments, we show that using an integral sliding surface for the switching action of TDCSA is better than using a PD-type sliding surface.

{"abstract": "The flow behind a vibrating flexible cable at low Reynolds numbers can exhibit complex wake structures such as lace-like patterns, vortex dislocations and frequency cells. These structures have been observed in experiments and numerical simulations, and are predicted by a previously developed low-order coupled map lattice (CML). The discrete (in time and space) CML models consist of a series of diffusively coupled circle map oscillators along the cable span. Motivated by a desire to modify the complex wake patterns behind flexible vibrating cables, we have studied the addition of control terms into the highly efficient CML models and explored the resulting dynamics. Proportional, adaptive proportional and discontinuous non-linear (DNL) control methods were used to derive the control laws. The first method employed occasional proportional feedback. The adaptive method used spatio-temporal feedback control. The DNL method used a discontinuous feedback linearization procedure, and the controller was designed for the resulting linearized system using eigenvalue assignment. These techniques were applied to a modeled vortex dislocation structure in the wake of a vibrating cable in uniform freestream flow. Parallel shedding patterns were achieved for a range of forcing frequency-forcing amplitude combinations studied to validate the control theory. The adaptive proportional and DNL methods were found to be more effective than the proportional control method due to the incorporation of a spatially varying feedback gain across the cylinder span. The DNL method was found to be the most efficient controller of the low-order CML model. The required control level across the cable span was correlated to the 1/1 lock-on behavior of the temporal circle map ", "keyword": "coupled map lattice; vortex shedding; wake; proportional feedback; coupled;circle map oscillators; spatio-temporal feedback control; temporal;circle map; vortex dislocation; 1/1 lock-on; discontinuous nonlinear;control; cylinder; low Reynolds numbers; vortex dislocations; vibrating;flexible cable;", "title": "Control of a coupled map lattice model for vortex shedding in the wake of a \tcylinder"}

{"abstract": "A decision tree is considered to be appropriate (1) if the tree can classify the unseen data accurately, and (2) if the size of the tree is small. One of the approaches to induce such a good decision tree is to add new attributes and their values to enhance the expressiveness of the training data at the data pre-processing stage. There are many existing methods for attribute extraction and construction, but constructing new attributes is still an art. These methods are very time consuming, and some of them need a priori knowledge of the data domain. They are not suitable for data mining dealing with large volumes of data. We propose a novel approach that the knowledge on attributes relevant to the class is extracted as association rules from the training data. The new attributes and the values are generated from the association rules among the originally given attributes. We elaborate on the method and investigate its feature.

{"abstract": "Class hierarchies form the backbone of many implemented knowledge representation and reasoning systems. They are used for inheritance, classification and transitive closure reasoning.

This paper presents an architecture and an implementation of a hierarchy reasoner that integrates a class hierarchy, a part hierarchy, and a containment hierarchy into one structure. In order to make an implemented reasoner useful, it needs to operate at least at speeds comparable to human reasoning. As real-world hierarchies are always large, special techniques need to be used to achieve this. We have developed a set of parallel algorithms and a data representation called maximally reduced tree cover for that purpose. The maximally reduced tree cover is an improvement of a materialized transitive closure representation which has appeared in the literature.

{"abstract": "In this paper we are concerned with the design, manufacture and performance test of a lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator (called LIPCA) using a top carbon fiber composite layer with near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), a middle PZT ceramic wafer, and a bottom glass/epoxy layer with a high CTE. The main point of the design for LIPCA is to replace the heavy metal layers of THUNDER TM by lightweight fiber reinforced plastic layers without losing the capabilities for generating high force and large displacement. It is possible to save up to about 40% of the weight if we replace the metallic backing material by the light fiber composite layer. We can also have design flexibility by selecting the fiber direction and the size of prepreg layers. In addition to the lightweight advantage and design flexibility, the proposed device can be manufactured without adhesive layers when we use an epoxy resin prepreg system. Glass/epoxy prepregs, a ceramic wafer with electrode surfaces, and a carbon prepreg were simply stacked and cured at an elevated temperature (177 degrees C) after following an autoclave bagging process. We found that the manufactured composite laminate device had a sufficient curvature after being detached from a flat mould. An analysis method using the classical lamination theory is presented to predict the curvature of LIPCA after curing at an elevated temperature. The predicted curvatures are in quite good agreement with the experimental values. In order to investigate the merits of LIPCA, performance tests of both LIPCA and THUNDER TM have been conducted under the same boundary conditions. From the experimental actuation tests, it was observed that the developed actuator could generate larger actuation displacement than THUNDER TM ", "keyword": "performance test; lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator; LIPCA; carbon;fiber composite layer; near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion; PZT;ceramic wafer; glass/epoxy layer; fiber reinforced plastic layers;;predicted curvatures; performance tests; boundary conditions; THUNDER;;177 degrees C; 177 degC;", "title": "Design and manufacture of a lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator"}

{"abstract": "Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are being embedded in or externally attached to smart structures because of the large amount of actuation deformation and force that these materials are capable of producing when they are heated. Previous investigations have focused primarily on using single or opposing SMA wires exhibiting the two-way shape memory effect (SME) because of the simplicity with which the repeatable actuation behavior of the structure can be predicted. This repeatable actuation behavior is achieved at the expense of reduced levels of recoverable deformation. Alternatively, many potential smart structure applications will employ multiple SMA wires exhibiting a permanent one-way SME to simplify fabrication and increase the recoverable strains in the structure. To employ the one-way wires, it is necessary to investigate how they affect the recovery of large strains when they are embedded in a structure. In this investigation, the large strain recovery of a one-way SMA wire embedded in a flexible polyurethane is characterized using the novel deformation measurement technique known as digital image correlation. These results are compared with a simple actuation model and a three-dimensional finite element analysis of the structure using the Brinson model for describing the thermomechanical behavior of the SMA. Results indicate that the level of actuation strain in the structure is substantially reduced by the inelastic behavior of the one-way SMA wires, and there are significant differences between the deformations of the matrix material adjacent to the SMA wires and in the region surrounding it. The transformation behavior of the SMA wires was also determined to be volume preserving, which had a significant effect on the transverse strain fields ", "keyword": "strain recovery; one-way shape memory; flexible polyurethanes; alloy wires; SMA;wires; actuation deformation; two-way shape memory effect; recoverable;strains; flexible polyurethane; embedded sensor; smart structures;;three-dimensional finite element analysis; actuation strain;;deformations; matrix material; transverse strain fields;", "title": "A fundamental investigation into large strain recovery of one-way shape memory \talloy wires embedded in flexible polyurethanes"}

By constructing the optimal performance function as a relative measure of the total kinetic energy, strain energy and input energy of the system, only three design variables need to be considered to achieve a balance between the desired higher damping effect and lower input cost. Modal control analysis is used to interpret the effects of three energy weight factors on the damping ratios and modal voltages and it is shown that the modal damping effect will increase with the kinetic energy weight factor, approaching square root (2/2) as the strain energy weight factor increases and decrease with the input energy weight factor.

{"abstract": "In this paper, various methods for the real-time estimation of multi-modal frequencies are realized in real time and compared through numerical and experimental tests. These parameter-based frequency estimation methods can be applied to various engineering fields such as communications, radar and adaptive vibration and noise control. Well-known frequency estimation methods are introduced and explained. The Bairstow method is introduced to find the roots of a characteristic equation for estimations of multi-modal frequencies, and the computational efficiency of the Bairstow method is shown quantitatively. For a simple numerical test, we consider two sinusoids of the same amplitudes mixed with various amounts of white noise. The test results show that the auto regressive (AR) and auto regressive and moving average (ARMA) methods are unsuitable in noisy environments. The other methods apart from the AR method have fast tracking capability. From the point of view of computational efficiency, the results reveal that the ARMA method is inefficient, while the cascade notch filter method is very effective. The linearized adaptive notch filter and recursive maximum likelihood methods have average performances. Experimental tests are devised to confirm the feasibility of real-time computations and to impose the severe conditions of drastically different amplitudes and of considerable changes of natural frequencies. We have performed experiments to extract the natural frequencies from the vibration signal of wing-like composite plates in real time. The natural frequencies of the specimen are changed by added masses. Especially, the AR method exhibits a remarkable performance in spite of the severe conditions.

{"abstract": "Much of the current rotorcraft research is focused on improving performance by reducing unwanted helicopter noise and vibration. One of the most promising active rotorcraft vibration control systems is an active trailing edge flap. In this paper, an induced-shear piezoelectric tube actuator is used in conjunction with a simple lever-cusp hinge amplification device to generate a useful combination of trailing edge flap deflections and hinge moments. A finite-element model of the actuator tube and trailing edge flap (including aerodynamic and inertial loading) was used to guide the design of the actuator-flap system. A full-scale induced shear tube actuator flap system was fabricated and bench top testing was conducted to validate the analysis. Hinge moments corresponding to various rotor speeds were applied to the actuator using mechanical springs. The testing demonstrated that for an applied electric field of 3 kV cm/sup -1/ the tube actuator deflected a representative full-scale 12 inch flap +or-2.8 degrees at 0 rpm and +or-1.4 degrees for a hinge moment simulating a 400 rpm condition. The per cent error between the predicted and experimental full-scale flap deflections ranged from 4% (low rpm) to 12.5% (large rpm).

{"abstract": "Iterative gradient methods such as Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) are in widespread use for source localization from electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals. Unfortunately, LM depends sensitively on the initial guess, necessitating repeated runs. This, combined with LM's high per-step cost, makes its computational burden quite high. To reduce this burden, we trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a realtime localizer. We used an analytical model of quasistatic electromagnetic propagation through a spherical head to map randomly chosen dipoles to sensor activities according to the sensor geometry of a 4D Neuroimaging Neuromag-122 MEG system, and trained a MLP to invert this mapping in the absence of noise or in the presence of various sorts of noise such as white Gaussian noise, correlated noise, or real brain noise. A MLP structure was chosen to trade off computation and accuracy. This MLP was trained four times, with each type of noise. We measured the effects of initial guesses on LM performance, which motivated a hybrid MLP-start-LM method, in which the trained MLP initializes LM. We also compared the localization performance of LM, MLPs, and hybrid MLP-start-LMs for realistic brain signals. Trained MLPs are much faster than other methods, while the hybrid MLP-start-LMs are faster and more accurate than fixed-4-start-LM. In particular, the hybrid MLP-start-LM initialized by a MLP trained with the real brain noise dataset is 60 times faster and is comparable in accuracy to random-20-start-LM, and this hybrid system (localization error: 0.28 cm, computation time: 36 ms) shows almost as good performance as optimal-1-start-LM (localization error: 0.23 cm, computation time: 22 ms), which initializes LM with the correct dipole location.

A variety of explicit-state verification tools use bisimulation minimization to check equivalence between systems, to minimize components before composition, or to reduce a state space prior to model checking.

We explore bisimulation minimization as an optimization in symbolic model checking of invariance properties. We consider three bisimulation minimization algorithms. From each, we produce a BDD-based model checker for invariant properties and compare this model checker to a conventional one based on backwards reachability.

{"abstract": "Visual description techniques are particularly important for the design of hybrid systems, because specifications of such systems usually have to be discussed between engineers from a number of different disciplines. Modularity is vital for hybrid systems not only because it allows to handle large systems, but also because it permits to think in terms of components, which is familiar to engineers. Based on two different interpretations for hierarchic graphs and on a clear hybrid computation model, we develop HyCharts. HyCharts consist of two modular visual formalisms, one for the specification of the architecture and one for the specification of the behavior of hybrid systems. The operators on hierarchic graphs enable us to give a surprisingly simple denotational semantics for many concepts known from statechart-like formalisms. Due to a very general composition operator, HyCharts can easily be composed with description techniques from other engineering disciplines. Such heterogeneous system specifications seem to be particularly appropriate for hybrid systems because of their interdisciplinary character ", "keyword": "visual specification; modular specification; hybrid systems; HyCharts; visual;description techniques; components; hierarchic graphs; hybrid;computation model; denotational semantics; statechart; heterogeneous;system specifications; formal specification;", "title": "Modular and visual specification of hybrid systems: an introduction to HyCharts"}

From these densities we derive an optimal policy such that for all states the most likely action maximizes the probability of reaching a predefined goal state. Liouville's conservation theorem tells us that the conditional density at time t, state s, and action a must equal the density at t + dt, s + ds, a + da.

The results are valid over most of the control parameter space of the system.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a pipelined broadcast that broadcasts a message of size m in O(m+n-1) time in an n-dimensional hypercube. It is based on the replication tree, which is derived from reachable sets. It has greatly improved performance compared to Ho-Kao's (1995) algorithm with the time of O(m[n/log(n+1)]). The communication in the broadcast uses an all-port wormhole router with message replication capability. This paper includes the algorithm together with performance comparisons to previous schemes in a practical implementation ", "keyword": "enhanced wormhole routers; message broadcast; n-dimensional hypercube;;replication tree; reachable sets; performance; communication;complexity; all-port wormhole router; message replication capability;;intermediate reception; pipelined broadcast;", "title": "Pipelined broadcast with enhanced wormhole routers"}
{"abstract": "Blocking probabilities in cellular mobile communication networks using dynamic channel assignment are hard to compute for realistic sized systems. This computational difficulty is due to the structure of the state space, which imposes strong coupling constraints amongst components of the occupancy vector. Approximate tractable models have been proposed, which have product form stationary state distributions. However, for real channel assignment schemes, the product form is a poor approximation and it is necessary to simulate the actual occupancy process in order to estimate the blocking probabilities. Meaningful estimates of the blocking probability typically require an enormous amount of CPU time for simulation, since blocking events are usually rare. Advanced simulation approaches use importance sampling (IS) to overcome this problem. We study two regimes under which blocking is a rare event: low-load and high cell capacity. Our simulations use the standard clock (SC) method. For low load, we propose a change of measure that we call static ISSC, which has bounded relative error. For high capacity, we use a change of measure that depends on the current state of the network occupancy. This is the dynamic ISSC method. We prove that this method yields zero variance estimators for single clique models, and we empirically show the advantages of this method over naive simulation for networks of moderate size and traffic loads ", "keyword": "blocking probability estimation; dynamic channel assignment; cellular mobile;communication networks; strong coupling constraints; occupancy vector;;approximate tractable models; product form stationary state;distributions; CPU time; simulation; importance sampling; low-load;;high cell capacity; standard clock method; static ISSC method; bounded;relative error; quality of service; dynamic ISSC method; zero variance;estimators; single clique models; network traffic load;", "title": "Estimation of blocking probabilities in cellular networks with dynamic channel \tassignment"}
{"abstract": "We show how to solve the maximal cut and partition problems using a randomized algorithm based on the cross-entropy method. For the maximal cut problem, the proposed algorithm employs an auxiliary Bernoulli distribution, which transforms the original deterministic network into an associated stochastic one, called the associated stochastic network (ASN). Each iteration of the randomized algorithm for the ASN involves the following two phases: (1) generation of random cuts using a multidimensional Ber(p) distribution and calculation of the associated cut lengths (objective functions) and some related quantities, such as rare-event probabilities; (2) updating the parameter vector p on the basis of the data collected in the first phase. We show that the Ber(p) distribution converges in distribution to a degenerated one, Ber(p/sub d/*), p/sub d/* = (p/sub d/,/sub 1/, p/sub d,n/) in the sense that some elements of p/sub d/*, will be unities and the rest zeros. The unity elements of p/sub d/* uniquely define a cut which will be taken as the estimate of the maximal cut. A similar approach is used for the partition problem. Supporting numerical results are given as well. Our numerical studies suggest that for the maximal cut and partition problems the proposed algorithm typically has polynomial complexity in the size of the network ", "keyword": "cross entropy method; Bernoulli distribution; deterministic network; rare event;simulation; associated stochastic network; random cuts; probability;;numerical results; polynomial complexity; combinatorial optimization;;importance sampling; maximal cut problems; partition problems;;randomized algorithm;", "title": "Cross-entropy and rare events for maximal cut and partition problems"}
{"abstract": "This article analyzes the transient buffer content distribution of a queue fed by a large number of Markov fluid sources. We characterize the probability of overflow at time t, given the current buffer level and the number of sources in the on-state. After scaling buffer and bandwidth resources by the number of sources n, we can apply large deviations techniques. The transient overflow probability decays exponentially in n. In the case of exponential on/off sources, we derive an expression for the decay rate of the rare event probability under consideration. For general Markov fluid sources, we present a plausible conjecture. We also provide the \"most likely path\" from the initial state to overflow (at time t). Knowledge of the decay rate and the most likely path to overflow leads to (i) approximations of the transient overflow probability and (ii) efficient simulation methods of the rare event of buffer overflow. The simulation methods, based on importance sampling, give a huge speed-up compared to straightforward simulations. The approximations are of low computational complexity and are accurate, as verified by means of simulation experiments ", "keyword": "large deviations analysis; Markov fluid inputs; transient buffer content;distribution; buffer resources; bandwidth resources; approximations;;transient overflow probability; simulation methods; importance;sampling; computational complexity; ATM multiplexers; IP routers;;queuing theory;", "title": "A large deviations analysis of the transient of a queue with many Markov fluid \tinputs: approximations and fast simulation"}
{"abstract": "Design and implementation of a sequential controller based on the concept of artificial neural networks for a flexible manufacturing system are presented. The recurrent neural network (RNN) type is used for such a purpose. Contrary to the programmable controller, an RNN-based sequential controller is based on a definite mathematical model rather than depending on the experience and trial and error techniques. The proposed controller is also more flexible because it is not limited by the restrictions of the finite state automata theory. Adequate guidelines of how to construct an RNN-based sequential controller are presented. These guidelines are applied to different case studies. The proposed controller is tested by simulations and real-time experiments. These tests prove the successfulness of the proposed controller performances. Theoretical as well as experimental results are presented and discussed indicating that the proposed design procedure using Elman's RNN can be effective in designing a sequential controller for event-based type manufacturing systems. In addition, the simulation results assure the effectiveness of the proposed controller to overcome the effect of noisy inputs ", "keyword": "Elman network; finite state automata; flexible manufacturing systems; ladder;language; noisy inputs; pneumatic system; programmable controller;;recurrent neural network; sequential control; learning; FMS;", "title": "Design and implementation of a flexible manufacturing control system using \tneural network"}

{"abstract": "Vibratory bowl feeders (VBFs) are machines that feed various small parts in large volume automatic assembly systems. Their shortcomings, like inflexibility and the propensity to jam, stem from the use of mechanical orienting devices. Air jet based orienting devices can be implemented to overcome these limitations. Applications of passive and active air jet based orienting devices that replace conventional devices for the VBF are discussed. Passive devices, which reject incorrectly oriented parts, are discussed first. Active air jet based orienting devices are then introduced to further improve the flexibility of VBFs. Since active devices reorient parts into a desired orientation, the part motion under their influence is analyzed. A number of tests demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of these new orienting devices ", "keyword": "vibratory bowl feeders; automatic assembly systems; passive air jet; active air;jet; orienting devices; parts feeding;", "title": "Flexible air-jet tooling for vibratory bowl feeder systems"}
